\par }{\i\cf2 *The appearance of the patient suggested}{ }{\b\cf2 mania}{, }{\i\cf2

" "}{\i\cf2 What bugs?" I asked}{. "}{\b\cf2

\par }{\i\cf2 *It was in a state of wild delirium. It was with great difficulty that the mother could hold it in her lap. It would forcibly throw out its legs and sti
ffen them, and at the same time throw then wide apart from each other. The arms were being constantly thrown out, as if trying to reach and get hold of something; and sometimes it seemed as if some object had been secured, and was for a moment fumbled in 
the fingers. The pupils were dilated and the eyes looked wild. Its cry was a kind of scream; a little froth was in the mouth; the surface of the skin was hot; the restlessness was very great}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [230].\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 *Began to look stupid, seemed to forget herself, and gave incoherent answers}{ (after one hour); }{\i\cf2 seemed to sit like a perfect idiot, for two and a half hours}{ (after two hours and a half); }{\i\cf2

at other times, with great eagerness, catching at imaginary objects with her hands, and declaring that she saw many people who were not present}{. She suffered a continuance of these symptoms with little variation, and totally without res
t for nine hours, being all this time restrained in bed by force in a raving and maniacal state, }{\fs18\cf2 [37].\{al\}
\par }{In about five minutes he became "wild, and didn't know any one." In ten minutes I found him seated in a chair, leaning forward on his knees, staring 
wildly, countenance bathed in perspiration, pupils largely dilated, talking vaguely, and perfectly unconscious of surrounding objects, pulse 90 and full, hands and arms convulsed, every few moments legs unable to support his body, and dragged after him wh
en we tried to get him to walk, }{\fs18\cf2 [205].\{al\}
\par }{Although he changed postures a little, yet he remained stupid for six or seven hours; then he raged furiously, requiring two persons to hold him in bed; notwithstanding which, he raised himself up, tossed greatly,

\par }{She is all the time inconsolable; much affected by trifles; makes much fuss about tr

\par }{\i\cf2 *The child had the look of one suffering from the effects of alcoholic drinks; an excited condition, not a moment quiet, constant motion of the hands and feet, at one time singing, jumping, whistling, with liv
ely grimaces, and a most jovial condition, in which she sang melodies in a perfectly correct manner; at another time she became excited, beat about her, jumped out of bed, reeled whenever she attempted to stand, and when she attempted to sit up fell over 
to either side; the next moment she had the most vivid hallucinations; talked much in a disconnected manner, it seemed as though her tongue could not follow her chaotic thoughts}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [232].\{al\}
\par }{Complete stupefaction and general insensibility to external impress
ions, only interrupted by a few transient moments of recognition; as a rule, they boy noticed nothing about him, did not recognize his parents and sisters, heard nothing and felt nothing; he seemed to be in a condition of frightful excitement, with consta
nt mental activity, as shown by the expression of the face and gesticulations, }{\i\cf2 appearing to be occupied with the most vivid fancies, especially joyous, and, at times, frightful images}{
; at times, when he was able to talk, his speech consisted of the most foo
lish and active delirium, with prattling; sometimes he seemed to be frightened, sometimes astonished, sometimes pathetic; but it was very seldom that he uttered intelligible words, and as a rule, there were no words, only a shrill screaming and groaning o
r loud laughing, with attempts to sing or whistle, }{\fs18\cf2 [233].\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 *She would}{, while held in her mother's lap, }{\i\cf2 suddenly start as if in terror, with outstretched arms and glaring eyes, and with such an effort that it required much exertion to hold her}{. This would
 last but a moment, during which she would cry incoherently; then a calm would come over her, and she would laugh, grasp at imaginary objects, conveying the hand to her mouth as if eating berries, point to something on the floor, etc., }{\fs18\cf2 [204].
\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 *He mutte
red unintelligible sounds, looked wildly around, and could not be made to do what he was told, though he apparently understood all that was going on. He kept wanting, seemingly, to clutch at some person or persons, whom he imagined were before him; but he
 could not use his arms, though he tried to do so}{ (after twelve hours), }{\fs18\cf2 [201].\{al\}
\par }{Complete insensibility, broken occasionally by a paroxysm, during which they would utter some indistinct sounds, and throw the hands about the head as if attempting to ward o
ff some threatening evil; this would soon subside into a semicomatose state, not the stupidity, however, which results from Opium or its preparations, but rather a state of intense apathy, which persisted for a few seconds, when the delirium would again r
e
cur unless sooner produced by the efforts of those about to render assistance, when the state of excitement assumed such a form and violence as to render necessary a certain amount of restraint to prevent escape from the imaginary object which engaged the
 attention; occasionally they would grasp at something in the space in front, appear as if they possessed or rejected it, then turn the head as if called by a voice beside them and attempt to speak to it; }{\b\cf2 
*the sound resembling a squeak more than the natural tone of the voice}{
. Neither of them was able to support himself alone upon his feet, but would take a step or two with staggering gait, falling to the floor as if intoxicated or in a state of complete exhaustion.
\par }{\i\cf2 *During the period of excitement the extremities were in constant motion, co-ordinate only so far as they related to the corresponding limb, yet wanting in that harmony of action which is found in those movements of a higher order}{
, as standing in the erect posture, walking, etc.; }{\i\cf2 there was constant action of the fingers as if attempting to pick something from the person or the bedclothes; at times they would burst into paroxysms of excessive laughter}{
, which would persist some seconds, then suddenly cease; at times they would have a smile, so quiet and pleasant, that we could not but contrast it with the highly excited state previously witnessed, }{\fs18\cf2 [193].\{al\}
\par }{*Sometimes she would appear for a moment to be relieved from her anxiety, and sit silent, with her eyes fixed on the ground, as if absorbed in contemplation; }{\i\cf2 
whilst her hands were employed in picking at the clothes, or anything that happened to be before her}{, similar to those in the last stage of some fevers.
\par }{\i\cf2 *Then, again, she would start involuntarily, qui
ck as if a shock of electricity had passed through her body, with an air of affright, and a loud shriek; her limbs writhed with convulsive motions, and her countenance and body distorted in every direction; apparently affected with great pain and anxiety}
{. 
At other times, in her intervals of ease, she would sing, and sometimes laugh, but could not be made to utter a word; neither did she appear to take notice of anything that was said to her. In short, the functions of her mind appeared to be entirely deran
ged. These paroxysms occurred at intervals of five or ten minutes, and continued about the same period. }{\b\cf2 
She manifested a great aversion to fluids of every kind. When a cup of water was brought to her lips, she would instantly start from it, and sometimes re
lapse into her paroxysm; so great was her aversion to it, that it was with the utmost difficulty a teaspoonful of any fluid could be forced down her throat}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [40].\{al\}
\par }{The appearance of the family was extremely ludicrous. The children were laughing, crying, singing, dancing, and playing all imaginable antic pranks. }{\i\cf2 
They had no correct estimation of distance, or the size of objects; were reaching their hands to catch hold of objects across the room, and again running against persons and things which they appeared to view as distant}{
. The nail-heads in the floor were pieces of money, which they eagerly tried to pick up. A boy, apparently fancying himself undressed, caught a hat belonging to a student, thrust his foot into it, pulled with both hands on the brim, 
and began to fret that he could not "get on his trowsers." The parents frequently called on the children to behave themselves; but their own actions being equally eccentric, they afforded a ridiculous exhibition of family government, }{\fs18\cf2 [109].\{
al\}
\par }{They turned
 natural fools upon it for several days. One would blow up a feather in the air, another would dart straws at it with great fury; another, stark naked, was sitting up in a corner, like a monkey, grinning and making mouths at them; a fourth would fondly ki
s
s and paw his companions, and sneer in their faces, with a countenance more antic than a Dutch doll. In this frantic condition they were confined, lest in their folly they should destroy themselves. In eleven days they recovered, unconscious of anything w
hich had passed, }{\fs18\cf2 [110].\{al\}
\par }{He became delirious, and knew nothing of himself until he was relieved; during this time he performed many queer antics; one time he was off to hitch up his team; again he gathered up sticks and placed them together to build a fi
re; then he would motion as though he would scrape lice and bugs together, shake them out of hats; pull the paper off the wall to get them out; pick them off himself and tramp them, etc.; see rats running and try to catch them; he was very talkative; did 
not know even his wife, nor where he was; wanted to go home, etc. (after fifteen to thirty minutes), }{\fs18\cf2 [234].\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 *Screaming, catching at imaginary objects in the air, or rather striking at them, for it was evident that these spectra were of a frightful natur
e, since at the moment of darting out the hand in the direction where the eyes were fixed, she always suddenly, and with great vehemence, withdrew herself, expressing the utmost terror in her look; at the same time screaming and sobbing violently}{
. Her eyes would, to appearance, follow the imaginary object for a moment or two, before she made the effort to escape from its supposed approach. }{\i\cf2 
She rapidly became furiously delirious, struck at, pushed, or attempted to bite, every person who came near, or any object that was offered to her}{
. In two and a half hours she knew no person, and had been wholly insensible to surrounding objects for above an hour and a half. She remained in this condition for about three hours, when a stage of coma supervened, lasting two 
hours. There was a return of the excitement, but not so severe as that which first presented itself; neither was it attended by ocular spectra, or tetanic spasm, }{\fs18\cf2 [102].\{al\}
\par }{
The first symptom was a high degree of exhilaration, in which she caused much merriment by her extravagant gestures and speeches. This soon became alarming, and when I was called to see her, she was laughing, crying, and singing, by turns, proceeding from
 
one to the other state with the greatest rapidity. She occasionally started with great force and alarm, crying out that she was going to fall, when she would cling to her mother with as much desperation as if she were about to be thrown from a precipice.

paregoric, I felt every symptom getting worse; the surface of my body was bathed with a clammy perspiration; whenever I attempted to close my eyes I was assailed by imaginary spectres, in the most hideous forms and menacing attitudes; and what was still t

w
riting was almost an unintelligible scrawl; I lay down again till evening, dizzy and incapable, with dull headache on vertex, but not much pain; I could not realize anything; my wife sitting by my bed seemed like a phantom, and I put out my hand occasiona

ly, to feel if she were a real existence. Before this extreme condition of bewilderment came on, I was excessively forgetful; would begin a sentence with a perfectly clear idea of what I intended to say, but forgot all about it before I had completely exp
ressed myself; also I used wrong words, and expressed my meaning badly. My speech was thick, as if my tongue were too large for my mouth, though I felt nothing wrong in my tongue, but only a sort of globbering articulation (ninth day), }{\fs18\cf2 [233].

g
o to sleep, which she was prevented from doing by the attendants walking, or, I should say, dragging her about the room, her limbs being so paralyzed that she could not walk, or even stand; and she presented a most perfect picture of intoxication. The sev

rity of the narcotism lasted about an hour, and was followed by a state of wakefulness, which lasted about twenty-four hours. During the first two weeks of her sickness, I gathered from her the symptoms, which she assured me were entirely new to her, and

\par }{The Arsenic is taken pure in some warm liquid, as coffee, fasting, beginning with a bit the size of a pin's head, and increasing to that of a pea. The comple
xion and general appearance are much improved, and the parties using it seldom look so old as they really are. The first dose is always followed by slight symptoms of poisoning, such as burning pain in the stomach and sickness, but not very severe. Once b
e
gun it can only be left off by very gradually diminishing the daily dose, as a sudden cessation causes sickness, burning pains in the stomach, and other symptoms of poisoning, very speedily followed by death. As a rule Arsenic-eaters are very long-lived, 
a
nd are peculiarly exempt from infectious diseases, fevers etc.; but unless they gradually give up the practice invariably die suddenly at last. In some Arsenic works near Salzburg, the only men who can stand the work for any time, are those who swallow da

 three or four hours a loose evacuation; this was followed by a keen appetite, and a feeling of excitement. With the exception of the pain, the same symptoms follow every increase of the dose. I subjoin as a caution, that it is not advisable to begin Arse

ic-eating before the age of twelve or after thirty years. Evil consequences only ensue from a long-continuing interruption. From circumstances I am often obliged to leave it off for two or three days, and I feel only slight languor and loss of appetite, a

irritating eruptions, which no remedy ever relieved except Turkish baths. The effects upon the nervous system were most remarkable, producing a thoroughly shattered constitution; great irritability, depression, and tendency to tears. These latter symptoms
 
were especially marked in the children, and also in servants who had come to the house in ordinarily good health, and who each became affected by degrees as above described. The list also includes giddiness, headache, acute earache, and neuralgia; bleedin

\par }{Three or four years a
fter occupying the room, or perhaps a little earlier, she began to have a feeling of general malaise. The first thing she recalls is a sensation of exhaustion. It was especially difficult for her to rise in the morning, although awake at a very early hour
.
 The debility increased as the illness went on. She would feel quite well and strong for a time, and would at once experience the sense of prostration on making any attempt at movement, and at times, on any unusual mental exertion, making the duties of a 
h
ousekeeper particularly onerous. She speedily increased considerably in weight, from about one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and sixty pounds. This condition lasted for some months, and then gave place to emaciation. At certain intervals afterwar
d
s the various symptoms of the digestive, nervous, and circulatory systems, which I shall mention, appeared and increased in severity up to the time I saw her. The precise date of the access of each symptom is unknown, but each had shown itself, either con
t
inuously or at intervals, for a number of years before. I found her in bed, perfectly prostrated, hardly able to move hand or foot; with skin very dry and rough; hands and feet cold or cool to myself and to the patient. Emaciation was marked; a countenanc
e
 naturally rosy had become sallow; tongue inflamed, dry, cracked, with a brownish coat in centre; gums also dry and angry. The sensation of dryness was apparent to herself, with a feeling as if the mouth were lined with flannel. No sensation of dryness or
 pain in the throat or \'9c
sophagus. Nausea often about 10 P.M., and nearly always when she awakened, but not during the night, unless she happened to be up and about for any purpose. At times pressure in the stomach; frequent thirst in the evening, seldom dur
ing the day; capricious appetite. During her early years she had often had diarrh\'9c
a, but she had been free from it for some years. Two or three years ago it came on at intervals; of late it had been more marked, the discharges watery and painful. Her eyes 
had for some time shown signs of weakness and congestion. They had previously been very strong. At last she could not open the lids at night without lifting them with her fingers. At the time I saw her there was marked conjunctivitis, as if from some exte
rnal irritation. No headache, but an "aching tired sensation" in base of brain. At times, during the past few years and never before, a tenderness in the neighborhood of the liver, which would pass away after slight diarrh\'9c
a. A carbuncle or perhaps a large 
boil on the back was reported as having occurred three or four years before. The sleep was more easily disturbed than when in health, and she had often wakened chilly or feverish. The feet and legs, to the knees, were frequently cramped, and had been reli
e
ved by warm applications and frictions. The symptoms detailed had always been, to a certain extent, relieved during absence from home; but in about ten days after her return the exhaustion and other evidences of disease would recur, and soon be as bad as

r
face, occasioned by the spasmodic contractions of the muscles of the abdomen, and even of the viscera; this unevenness extended from the epigastric region to the pubis, and to the right and left hypochondrium. He complained of extreme faintness, and dread
f
ul sickness. He had been violently purged; the alvine secretions were all of a bright homogeneous green color, like paint. Each effort of vomiting and purging was preceded and followed by these painful gripings and spasmodic contractions of the abdominal 
muscles. He also complained of great heat in the stomach, which he compared to a furnace, or red-hot irons, which sensation commenced at the tongue, and was felt throughout the course of the \'9c
sophagus to the cardia, or upper orifice of the stomach; insatiab
le thirst, violent headache, the eyes impatient of light, but the pupils sensible, and the extremities cold. The patient attempted in this dreadful state to get out of bed, to walk to the night table; he was directly seized with vertigo, dimness of sight,
 
and palpitation of the heart; he fell down, and went off into an epileptic fit; he was assisted on the bed, and in a few minutes recovered from the fit (first day). In the early part of the morning he had another attack of epilepsy; the symptomatic fever

eat, headache, and vertigo (second day). Skin moist and more temperate, tongue less coated, not dry, but sore and swollen, the burning heat in the stomach rather less violent, and he expressed a degree of hunger; the pulse 98, spasmodic twitches in the ar

and lower extremities (fifth day). He complained of a very singular affection in the upper and lower extremities; the arms were several times in the course of the day seized with a numbness and prickly feeling, accompanied with a sense of great weight, li
k
e what is commonly called being asleep; and this symptom continued daily, more or less frequently, for six weeks, but upon raising the arms in an upright position, it immediately subsided. The same feeling almost as constantly attacked the legs, but occas

he would recover, "the fits becoming every day shorter, and recovery from each more rapid and complete." But they again returned with the same or even greater degree of violence, and he has been afflicted with fits up to the present time; he appears to ha

rer and began to discharge a thin pus, and to form granulations; three weeks after the exfoliation, the ulcer was cicatrized, }{\fs18\cf2 [74].\{al\}

\par }{Seized with toothache, and swelling on the right side of the lower jaw; to relieve it the gums were lanced, and, finally, the tooth extracted;
 after this the pain ceased, but the swelling gradually increased, until a spontaneous opening formed on the under side of the jaw, with a discharge of pus, which has continued since; she remained in the factory until one week previous to her admission in
t
o the hospital. Upon examination after her admission, the inferior maxilla was found necrosed on the right side, and partially on the left; the jaw was painful, and that side of the face swollen; the discharge was at times profuse, and apart of it took pl
ace through the buccal cavity, rendering it very annoying; her appetite was good, but mastication difficult and painful; the necrosis gradually extended, but her general health continued good, }{\fs18\cf2 [98].\{al\}
\par }{Two years ago he began to be troubled with carious tee
th: the three molars on the left side of the lower jaw became so painful that he was obliged to masticate on the right side exclusively. Afterwards the teeth on the right side pained him, and he was forced to employ the left ones again. Two months ago he 
t
ook cold, and after a few days, he found a swelling about the left side of the lower jaw, accompanied with pains in the bone, extending to different parts of the head and face. He had three teeth extracted, which were rotted away at their crowns, but thei
r
 fangs were entire. At the time of his admission, the three remaining incisors were quite loose; entire gum on left side swollen and spongy; fetid pus escaping on the slightest pressure, from the previous site of the extracted teeth; a probe passed into t
h
ese openings strikes on bare bone; over these parts there was considerable exterior swelling; pulse quick and feeble; general strength impaired; face puffy and very pallid; sleep disturbed by pain in the jaws and general articular pains. The pain and swel
l
ing increased on the right half of the face, speedily bringing it into the same condition as the half first affected. The ulceration of the gum over the diseased alveoli advanced; and as the several openings became confluent, the alveolar margin of the bo
n
e became exposed. The soft parts rapidly retracted from the surface of the bone, and the denudation became every day more complete, and its exposure was attended with a copious and most fetid suppuration. From then until now the only difference that has o
ccurred has consisted in the gradually advancing isolation of the bone, }{\fs18\cf2 [82].\{al\}
\par }{Began to suffer with toothache in the right side of lower jaw; this lasted for some time, and was followed soon by a hard lump upon the outside of the jaw; the pain continued 
to increase and the swelling to enlarge until an abscess formed in the submaxillary region, and burst, and discharged a large quantity of purulent matter. Upon introducing a probe into the discharging orifice, I found that it led directly to the jaw, whic
h
 was deprived of its periosteum and in a necrosed condition; there was, however, no indication that exfoliation had taken place from any part of the jaw, but, on the contrary, the whole bone was firm and solid. At this time the disease seemed to extended 
o
nly from the right lower canine tooth to the angle of the same side of the jaw. Later he presented himself in a condition much worse than before, now from weakness and exhaustion he had been forced to give up his occupation. All the teeth upon the right s
i
de of the jaw have loosened and fallen out; besides several openings upon the outside of the face, that were freely discharging pus, there were two or three inside of the mouth, from which there issued a large quantity also, and which led directly to the 
d
iseased bone. The disease now seemed to involve the whole of the right side of the lower jaw, without there being made the least attempt, seemingly, by the periosteum to replace the dead bone with a new casing of osseous deposit such as usually forms in o
r
dinary cases of necrosis; nor was there any disposition to exfoliate or to form a sequestrum, but on the contrary the whole jaw was as firm and solid as at the time when it was first examined. His constitution had now become seriously affected, as he was 
m
uch emaciated and weakened by the great drain of pus that was constantly poured forth from the diseased parts. Later, in the mouth can be felt and easily seen the denuded jaw for an extent of two inches. His breath smells very offensively. The disease now
 extends from the right temporal-maxillary articulation to the left lower canine tooth. He cannot eat solid food, though his appetite is tolerably good, }{\fs18\cf2 [104].\{al\}
\par }{During the last half year she had occ
asionally suffered from toothache on the right side of the lower jaw. In a few months it became more severe and ceased to be limited to the carious teeth, and extended through the whole jaw, over the cheek, and even to the temporal region and the neck. At
 
the same time considerable febrile disturbance, with occasional rigors, supervened, accompanied by swelling of gums and cheek with erysipelatous redness of the latter. On admittance, the examination showed the right cheek much swollen, and very tense towa
r
ds the eye, the mouth, the chin, and neck; the tenderness most considerable in the vicinity of the lower jaw. Pain deepseated, throbbing, piercing, concentrated at the angle of the jaw, and radiating thence over the adjacent soft parts. Extreme tenderness
 
on pressure. The gums of the diseased side of the jaw much swollen, tense, darkened, and tender; the mucous membrane of the cheek equally so; between the angle of the jaw and first molar, fetid pus of a phlegmonous character oozed out on pressure. The fir
s
t and fourth molars on the right side of the lower jaw were carious, the other molars deficient. The swelling of the gums increased, became more tense, extended to the soft palate; dysphagia and salivation supervened, and the jaw became almost immovable. 
S
uppuration increased, pus laudable, but fetid. During the second week, the four incisors and one molar became loosened, suppuration ichorous and rusty, gums softened and livid, formation of sinuses on the external and internal surface, through which the p
r
obe reached the bone, which appeared in part rough, in part smooth. In the progress of the disease, increased retraction of gums from the alveolar surface, fresh abscesses, increased discoloration, and burrowing sinuses, so that the entire jaw was exposed
 to the probe, both externally and internally. The bone appeared almost entirely detached from the soft parts, floating in an excessively sanious fluid, }{\fs18\cf2 [81].\{al\}
\par }{The disease appeared to commence by a swelling in that part of the jaw whence a tooth had been
 extracted two years before; the swelling continued to extend until the entire bone became affected. He said that he had suffered great pain through the entire jaw, and that his nights had been sleepless. He looked very ill, was much emaciated, and he pre
s
ented a curious appearance of the mouth, which was pursed up into a round aperture in consequence of the protrusion forward of the enlarged jaw. There were two fistulous openings, one on each side of the upper part of the neck; and a probe introduced stru
c
k the angle of the jaw, which was quite dead. I examined the mouth and found the jaw quite dead. I could distinguish every part of the bone except the condyles, which were imbedded in soft tissue. There was a large quantity of fetid discharge around the b
one, but the principal part came from the vicinity of the condyles. The outside of the cheeks about the masseteric regions was much thickened. The teeth were all gone, and the appearance of the jaw was that from an edentulated cranium, }{\fs18\cf2 [124].
\{al\}
\par }{Toothache in the left lower jaw, formation of an ulcer on the side of the middle back tooth with violent pains; as the ulcer opened a piece of bone was discharged; at last the cheek became swollen }{\i\cf2 and erysipelatous and abscesses}{
 formed, which discharged much matter; the necrosis of the bone progressed until the whole half of the lower jaw had to be removed, }{\fs18\cf2 [70].\{al\}
\par }{A carious molar of the right side of the lower jaw was extracted; from this time (seven months since) the peculiar Phosphorus necrosis may be said to ha
ve fairly begun, and it progressed rapidly, for the subject of it was compelled to give up the charge of his department about a fortnight after the tooth was drawn. The face was very much deformed by indurated swelling, which was particularly conspicuous 
o
n the right side and about the chin; three fistulous openings, surrounded by flabby granulations, were upon the right side of the neck; from these fetid pus exuded freely; a horribly offensive odor came from the mouth, and saliva and pus were constantly d
r
ibbling out; the gums were spongy on the margin, but partook of the general induration at the sides; four sound but loose teeth occupied the right alveolar cavities; the upper jaw seemed healthy; the patient could not part the two jaws sufficiently to int
r
oduce a finger with facility; a probe detected necrosed bone both on examination in the mouth and through the sinuses; the examinations gave excessive pain; a portion of the left lower jaw only seemed clear of the disease; the symphysis was completely inv
olved, }{\fs18\cf2 [152].\{al\}
\par }{The disease seems first to attack the gum of diseased teeth; it usually makes its appearance in a year or a year and a half after beginning work in the factory; it is still questionable whether the disease is due to Phosphorus, Phosphoric 
acid, or to the ozone generated by the Phosphorus, or even whether it may not be due to general chronic Phosphorus poisoning. }{\i\cf2 The lower jaw was affected in nine cases out of ten}{
, the upper jaw in one case; the disease very seldom spread from the upper jaw 
to the bones of the face. The first symptom was tensive pain in the teeth, then looseness of the teeth and discharge of matter between the gum and teeth; if now the teeth be drawn the swelling and pain increase and involve the whole half of the jaw; usual
l
y the disease progresses slowly and irregularly, with transient periods of improvement; the soft parts covering the jaws, cheeks, sides of the mouth, become swollen and intolerably painful; one tooth after another becomes loose, and every pressure upon th
e
 gum causes discharge of pus; the pus often is discharged through the cheek externally. The skin of the margin of the lower jaw becomes red, soft, loosens, and at last infiltrated; from this infiltration there follows a discharge of matter that seems to c
o
me from the alveolar process; wherever the opening is probed denuded bone is found; at the same time it is found that the periosteum that has been loosened from the bone has a new deposit of bone on its inner surface, so that the sound passes between two 
surfaces of bone, one consisting of old bone, the other of new growth; the denuded bone decays in various directions and is gradually discharged with the matter.
\par After two or three years these necrosed pieces of bone separate from the whole extent of the jaw.
\par With this the patient suffers from fever, at times violent, considerable emaciation; nutrition is very much disturbed on account of the difficulty of swallowing, and the digestion suffers on account of the mixture of offensive matter with the food; slee
p at night is possible only by means of increasing doses of Morphia, and the patient gradually sinks with hectic and exhaustion. }{\b\cf2 
During the prostration tuberculosis frequent develops; at times also lobular pneumonia, terminating in gangrene of the lung and pyoh\'e6mia}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [180].\{al\}
\par }{The Phosphorus disease of the jaw consists in the first stage of an inflammatory swelling of the gum and soft parts of the mouth, extending over the face and neck, associated with the development of masses of osteophyte of varying ext
ent and thickness about the jaw; in the second stage the teeth become black, the gum recedes, the osteophytes suppurate, and the jaw becomes denuded, rough, and blackish or grayish-green, and the teeth fall out; this stage is associated with the most viol
e
nt pain in the face and head, disturbance of digestion, sleeplessness, fever, salivation, fistulous burrowing of the matter in the muscles and integuments of the face, which became erysipelatous, followed by exfoliation of the bone, and sometimes by exten
sion of the necrosis to all the bones of the skull, and death with hectic fever, }{\fs18\cf2 [87].\{al\}
\par }{Necrosis of the jaw; the disease begins as toothache, involving one or more teeth in the upper or lower jaw; the disease spreads to the jawbone, which increases in vo
lume and becomes painful to pressure; afterwards the soft parts become swollen, especially the gums and cheeks, in the latter erysipelatous inflammation develops, even extending over the whole side of the face and down on to the neck; the patients have fe
v
er, yellow color of the skin, especially of the face, loss of appetite, thirst, irregular stools; the pain at last extends to the ear and temple, with increased secretion of saliva. Various teeth become loose, and between them there is a discharge of offe
n
sive matter, that collects in various parts of the jaw under the gum or under the skin externally, and gradually makes its way into the mouth or through the skin, usually by a number of circuitous channels. The teeth fall out, the jaw becomes denuded, and
 the necrosis either becomes circumscribed or involves the whole jaw, }{\fs18\cf2 [72].\{al\}
\par }{Diseases of the gums and maxillary bones, terminating in necrosis and sometimes in death, were not uncommon; the complaints only appeared after a sojourn in the factory for at l
east two years, and in individuals habitually exposed to the fumes; all the workmen whom he had observed had decayed teeth before the disease commenced, not unfrequently before commencing the manufacture; many other workmen with sound teeth have preserved
 them in the midst of phosphoric vapors, a fact which induces him to believe that carious teeth constitute a predisposing cause of the disease, }{\fs18\cf2 [67].\{al\}
\par }{The disorder at first resembled ordinary toothache, attended however, with swelling of the face; as the
 severity of the symptoms increased she became a patient at the Royal Infirmary, but derived little benefit from the treatment; six months later all the teeth on the right side of the lower jaw fell out, or were removed without difficulty, before the jaw 
w
as removed, and on the left side as far as the second bicuspid, all the teeth were sound. There is a great deal of new callus thrown out in the situation of the old bone, so much so that there will be scarcely any disfigurement from the loss of the jaw, a
 little from the loss of the teeth; she can close her jaw and chew her meat and bread well; the bone and teeth of the upper jaw are in a perfectly healthy state, and she now enjoys excellent health, }{\fs18\cf2 [86].\{al\}
\par }{Scrofulous subjects are most affected, and in th
em the disease is most fatal; almost all the girls employed have the gums more or less affected, and at their junction with the teeth a red ulcerated line, like that produced by mercurial salivation, is apparent. When the individual is robust and the necr
osis is confined to a small portion of the bone, exfoliation takes place and a gradual cure follows, but where there exists any tendency to scrofula, phthisis becomes developed, and the patient sinks under the combination, }{\fs18\cf2 [68].\{al\}

extensive gangrenous periostitis of the tibia, with severe febrile disturbance, supervened; the periosteum peeled off from a large area upwards, as far as the knee-joint; the bone was rough}{

ere threatening to completely exhaust the patient, amputation of the femur above the condyles was performed on the 4th of February. During the operation it was observed that the periosteum, although of normal thickness, and apparently of intact structure,
 
adhered but very loosely to the bone, and could be turned back as far as the condyles with the greatest facility. We were obliged to take away the sutures a few days after the operation on account of the great pressure of the shaft of the bone against the
 
soft parts; as soon as this was done, the periosteum of the whole circumference of the shaft peeled off right up to the trochanter minor, and fell back with the soft parts in the form of a flabby funnel-shaped sac, so that the superficially necrosed shaft

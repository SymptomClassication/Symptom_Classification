may by caused by the more powerful contraction of the left ventricle, or a loss of elasticity in the vessel, allowing it to yield more to the ventricular action. I infer the latter to be the true explanation, because the total length of curve or curves, s

n
g 40 in a minute. Having roused her from her sleep with great difficulty, she vomited abundantly. She then for the first time expressed great alarm at finding herself totally blind. The pupils were not much if any dilated, but were insensible to the impre
s
sion of the strongest light. She stated that she had most horrid dreams, and complained of a dreadful sensation at the pit of her stomach, which still she did not call pain. She begged to be let sleep again, but in spite of all our efforts to the contrary
,
 her head drooped on her chest, heavy sleep came on, which in a few minutes ended in a convulsion, such as before described, and this again was succeeded by vomiting and a perfect restoration of consciousness. This state of things was constantly repeated 
f
or several hours. When in sleep her pulse fell gradually, being sometimes as low as 20 in a minute, but when roused, never beyond 40 in a minute. She expressed, when awake, a great desire fore cool air, which afforded great relief. This state of things co
ntinued till 4 o'clock, when she complained of acute agonizing pain in the back of the neck and about the base of the brain, with violent permanent spasms in both arms, extending to the fingers. From this time on she recovered, }{\fs18\cf2 [59].\{al\}

o
ke, complaining of feeling cold. He remained awake for a few minutes, during which time he appeared perfectly rational; there was great numbness of the mouth, tongue, lips, cheeks and extremities, and a strange dull feeling in the head. He then relapsed i
n
to the comatose condition, relieved every five or six minutes by his efforts at vomiting. The depressed state of the heart and circulation, and the consequent coma and coldness of the surface, called for a strong cardiac stimulant, and I gave him one-drop
 
doses of Tr. digitalis in a teaspoonful of water, every five minutes. The vomiting continued, and the pulse at the pulse at the wrist was imperceptible for ten or fifteen minutes at a time; only a faint, confused movement of the heart was perceptible by a

indistinct." In twenty minutes she felt sick, and made efforts to vomit, but could bring nothing up; she was then anxious to get upstairs to bed, but her legs failing she only reached the first floor, and threw herself upon the sofa; there she remained fo

hen gave a heavy sigh, and tossed the arms backward above the head, at the same time attempting by jerks to shift her position. There was also rattling and vibration of the trachea. Upon taking an emetic she was seized with a strong convulsive fit, the ey
es being drawn upwards under the lids, the fists clenched across the throat, and the teeth grating violently together, and a thick, ropy, frothy saliva was forced through the lips. At this moment her urine and f\'e6
ces passed unconsciously. In two or three min
utes the convulsive state passed off. She says that the reason why she does not sleep is because she cannot keep the eyelids closed. This is singular and consistent with the fixed and staring condition of the eyes, and bears some relation to the contracte

after taking the dose she was lying upon a sofa, resting upon her back, with her eyelids closed and the pupils slightly contracted. She was quite unconscious when spoken to, and during an hour's observation she only spoke intelligibly twice, and then said
,
 "What is it?" Every now and then she uttered a peculiar plaintive cry. She was continually moving her tongue round the interior of her mouth, from time to time thrusting the organ out beyond the lips, and moving it from side to side. The pulse was weak b

d
ilated. The pulse was feeble and irregular, respiration requiring artificial aid to support it, and the muscles and ligaments so much relaxed that he could neither stand nor sit up unless supported. His respiration finally degenerated to a gasp, occurring
 
five or six times to the minute, then he would convulsively straighten out in the lap of his attendant, throw his head and shoulders back, and his hands over his head, as if, mechanically, to get a longer and fuller respiration, then relax into the same s

Breathing extremely slow and slightly stertorous; pulse very feeble, and scarcely counting 40 in the minute; extreme pallor of the countenance; she was speechless from debility, the expression of the countenance showing the intellect was still clear. The

ashes of heat, almost constantly breaking into each other, lasting thirty-five minutes (the tingling and nervousness continues). Then a dry heat set in, with a peculiar tenderness of the flesh to the touch, and nervous anxiety. Thirteen minutes after the

\par The first doses of from 1/2 grain to 5 grains caused only frequent eructations, diminished appetite, scanty stools, and, somewhat later, a dull headache, especially in the frontal region, lasting some hours. D
oses of 5 1/2 to 10 grains caused pressure in abdominal region, distension of the abdomen, slight griping about the navel, nausea, white coating of the tongue, diminished appetite, dryness and scraping in the throat. In addition, a sensation of heaviness

and after nine hours tension in the lumbar region. In the same person there was weakness of memory, apparently occurring in connection with the above-mentioned mental restlessness, which did not allow him to fix his attention for any length of time, }{

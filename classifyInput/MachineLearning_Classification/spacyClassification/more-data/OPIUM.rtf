ss of the head, tingling in every limb; the eyes seem to be enlarged, and the ears sharpened to hearing; an elasticity and inclination to mount on high are experienced; all pains are gone, and pleasure now remains; all weariness has vanished, and freshnes
s
 takes its place; the loathing of food previously experienced is changed to a relish for what is piquant, and a great desire is often felt for some particular food; the tongue is now loosened and tells its tale, for whatever is secret becomes open, and wh
a
t was intended for one becomes known to all. Still there is no excitement, but rather a calmness, soft, soothing, and sedative. He dreams not, nor thinks of the morrow; but, with a smile in his eye, fills his pipe with the last of his allowance. Slowly in
h
aling it he seems to brighten up, the smile that sparkled in his eye extends to other features, and his appearance is one of complete yet placid enjoyment. Presently the pipe is slowly displaced, or drops by his side; his head, if raised, is now laid on t
h
e pillow; feature after feature gives up its smile; the eye becomes glazed; the upper eyelid drops; the chin and lower lip fall; deeper and deeper inspirations follow; all perception is gone; objects may strike the eye, but no sights are seen; sounds may 
fall on the ear, but none are heard, and so he passes into sleep, disturbed and broken, from which the wretched being awakes to a full conception of his miseries, }{\fs18\cf2 [232].\{al\}
\par }{The effects produced on the health by abandoning the habit of Opium-smoking, after 
it has become deeply rooted, are even worse than the perseverance in it. A gloomy despondency is added to the usual symptoms of the ordinary stage of depression; a state ensues somewhat like a low state of delirium tremens, attended with extreme prostrati
on of strength, and often with exhausting diarrh\'9c
a and vomiting; all pre-existing diseases are aggravated, dropsy frequently ensues, and death may soon result, most generally by effusion into the great cavities, and general anasarca. When these effects have
 begun to show themselves under a compulsory cessation of the habit, the most marked improvement of health is produced by resuming it. The result of the examination of several hundred Opium-smokers on this point was, that, by their own confession, the ext
e
nt of their indulgence was limited only by their means, and the spontaneous abandonment of it impossible. The writer of an essay on the Opium trade says, "There is no slavery on earth to name with the bondage into which Opium casts its victims; there is s
carcely one known instance of escape from its toils, when once they have fairly enveloped a man," }{\fs18\cf2 [232].\{al\}
\par }{The effects were strongest if I were unwell, or if anything had in the least deranged the functions of the economy; for instance, if I had been 
up all night; if I had been sick and vomited, and taken no food, 2 or 3 grains would have as much effect as otherwise 4 or 5 grains, }{\fs18\cf2 [130].\{al\}

\par }{If deprived of laudanum for a single day, the most unpleasant symptoms came on; loss of sleep and appetite and an indescribable feeling of languor, with a corresponding depression of spirits, and slight involuntary motions o

\par }{If the dose be not taken at the usual time, there is great prostration, vertigo, torpor discharge of water from the eyes, and in some an involuntary discharge of semen, even when wide awake. If the privation be complete, a stil
l more formidable train of phenomena takes place. Coldness is felt over the whole body, with aching pains in all parts. Diarrh\'9c

\par }{At length their whole organization assimilated to such a state of mind and body, and they have grown up to the size of manhood, with the avenues of their brains practically closed by drugs, so that they still have merely infantile powers of m

\par }{Most Opium-eaters dislike wine and brandy; but this is not always the case. The exhilaration is most striking in the state of the mind; all is order, harmony, vigor, and tranquillity;
 there is no shadow of that brutality which most decidedly belongs, more or less, to vinous intoxication. No greater misery can be felt than the Opium-eater experiences when his accustomed stimulus fails him, or the dreadful reaction sets in, which is as 
s
triking to observers as it is painful tohimself; the mind is much enfeebled; the eyes lack lustre; the sensations are all disordered; the appetite is lost; the limbs seem incapable of supporting the body's load; existence is loathsome; no substitute can b

 found for the potent juice, for to the greater number of the lovers of Opium wine and brandy are disgusting; they nauseate instead of diffusing a genial glow. The accustomed dram is the only relief to be found in this sad state, and the deluded victim fl

i
se increased, the head was heavy, and I experienced loss of energy. That night I slept none at all, but there were no disagreeable symptoms. During the whole time that I remained in bed I had no sensation in the head, but on rising in the morning the mala
i
se returned. Towards 11 A.M. I was seized with vertigo, which seemed to me the precursor of the migraine to which I had been subject for more than twenty years. It disappeared and gave place to a headache, which passed off in about three-quarters of an ho

cordial anxiety, with pain in the stomach, to which I had formerly been subject with the migraine. I was soon obliged to sit down and rest, and I found myself covered with cold sweat, excessively fatigued, succeeded by nausea

\par Finding no relief I lost sixteen ounces of blood; in a short time after I felt much better. The blood which was drawn had an inflammatory crust formed on
 the surface; it coagulated very firmly, and the edges by retracting within the bowl and turning up, exhibited the cupped appearance; there was a large proportion of serum, }{\fs18\cf2 [352].\{al\}
\par }{He was in normal health, and had fasted eighteen hours before commencing
 the experiment. He had never smoked tobacco. Twenty-seven pipes, equivalent to 107 grains of the Opium used by the Chinese, were smoked in two hours and three-quarters, at tolerably regular intervals. The third removed the feeling of hunger caused by his
 
long fast, and his pulse rose from 72 to 80. The fourth and fifth caused slight heaviness and desire for sleep, but there was no hesitation in giving correct answers, though he could not guide himself about the room. After the seventh pipe the pulse fell 
t
o 70. The twelfth pipe was followed by singing in the ears, and after the thirteenth he laughed heartily, though without any cause that he can remember. Questions asked at this time were answered only after a pause, and not always correctly. He had for so
m
e time ceased to be conscious of his actions. After the twenty-fifth pipe, questions asked in a loud tone were not answered. After the last pipe had been smoked, he remarked, "I do not hear well." Forty minutes later there was a slight return of conscious
n
ess, and he said, "I am quite bewildered. May I smoke some more? Is the man with the pipe gone already?" Fifteen minutes later (4.55 P.M.) he was able to go home, and then retired to bed. He woke next morning at 3 A.M., and made a hearty meal, after his f
a
st of thirty-three hours. During the next day he felt as if he had bees in a great hollow in his head, as well as a slight headache. The organs of locomotion were first affected, next came sight and hearing, but Herr Maclay is very positive that there wer

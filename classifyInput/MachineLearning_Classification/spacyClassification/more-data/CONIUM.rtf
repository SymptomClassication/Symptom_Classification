\par }{Soon after half an hour, dimness of vision, with bright points scintillating, or rather quickly moving in the distance; this caused me to turn from side to

sparent vapor were floating between the eye and the object, the effect being identical with that observed on looking through a medium of unequal density, such as the mixture of hot and cold air enveloping a highly heated stove; it occurs independently of 
a
ny dilatation of the pupil, and is compatible with good definition for fixed objects; it is due to imperfect adjustment of the refracting media of the eye from partial paralysis of the ciliary branches of the third nerve; it is through these minute branch
e
s that the individual first becomes conscious of the effect of hemlock, and if he should be reading at the time, he will suddenly find the occupation fatiguing, and very soon afterwards it may be impossible, and he will be glad to close the eyes to reliev
e
 himself of the symptom, and as the muscular lethargy begins to be felt, content to lie perfectly still as is asleep; in full doses the depressing influence involves the other branches of the nerve, and the lazy movements of the eyeball, or dull fixed and
 occasionally divergent stare, indicate the partially paralyzed condition of the }{\i\cf2 external muscles of the eyeball}{, while more or less drooping of the upper lids expresses a similar condition of the levator palpebr\'e6, }{\fs18\cf2 [42].\{al\}

\par }{\i\cf2 *There was a sluggishness of the adaptation of the eye}{; my vision was good for fixed objects, but when an uneven object was put in motion before the eyes there was a haze and dimness of vision, producing a feeling of giddiness, }{\fs18\cf2 
[42].\{al\}
\par }{On raising my eyes from the object upon which they
 had been fixed to a more distant one the vision was confused and a feeling of giddiness suddenly came over me. That these symptoms were due to impairment of power in the muscular apparatus employed in the adaptation of the eye was obvious to me, for so l
o
ng as my eyes were fixed on a given object the giddiness disappeared, and the definition and capacity of vision for the minutest objects were unimpaired, but the instant that I directed the eyes to another object all was haze and confusion, and I felt gid
d
y, and in order to recover my vision, and dismiss the sense of giddiness, it was necessary to lay hold upon some object, as it were, with my eyes, and rest them securely upon it; it was clear to me that the adjusting muscular apparatus of the eye was enfe
e
bled, and its contractions so sluggishly performed that they could not longer keep pace with the more active movements of the external muscles of the eyeball; within then minutes of the appearance of this disorder of vision a general muscular lethargy aff
ected me, and the eyelids felt as heavy as if they were oppressed with the deepest drowsiness (three-quarters of an hour after 5 1/2 drachms), }{\fs18\cf2 [42].\{al\}
\par }{Raised my eyes quickly from the manuscript upon which they had been steadily fixed, towards the inkstand
 some little distance away, but in so doing I instantly experienced a slight difficulty in accurately sighting that object, the eyes did not strike exactly where they were aimed, and simultaneously a faint but distinct thrill of the peculiar swimming feel
i
ng that I know so well as the beginning of sea-sickness, swept through the brain; plainly the subtle influence of the poison had been creeping over me while absorbed in writing, but could not declare itself by symptoms until a quick and decided movement o
f
 the already paretic ocular muscles was attempted, then, however, it was instantly made manifest by the trouble in promptly sighting a given object, and, what is the point, then at once, but not till then, was the least giddiness experienced; as the palsy
 
of the ocular muscles advanced, soon the slightest movement of the eyes produced a curious and very disagreeable apparent flickering of the field of view, and was always accompanied by a sudden rush of giddiness; but so long as the eyes were kept motionle
ss, ten, as long ago pointed out by Harley, there was no giddiness; for experiment, however, I }{\i\cf2 did}{
 try the eyes in various ways, seeking to find, among other things, how the focalizing power on near objects was affected, and the consequence was that I quick
ly became not only very giddy but also decidedly nauseated, in fact veritably sea-sick, the sensations being the same as those felt at sea; fearing that I should vomit, I got up to cross the room to the washstand, but at once the floor seemed to rock and 
w
aver, I staggered against a table; not being conscious, however, of any real weakness of the legs, it immediately struck me that the uncertainty of step was purely because the eyes were playing false as guides for the feet; if so, I argued, walking ought 
t
o be steadier with the eyes shut than open. Accordingly, after getting the proper bearings, I shut the eyes, and sure enough found at once that I could now walk straight and steady, and, what was more, without any feeling of giddiness; securing a basin I 
repeated the little experiment on the return trip to the desk, and with precisely the same result,-giddiness, transient nausea, and staggering gait on trying to walk with eyes open;-freedom from all trouble with them shut, }{\fs18\cf2 [45].\{al\}

\par It affects the skin of most people in a very painful manner, and the inflammation speedily spreads from one part of the body to another. Some people are so affected that their faces could not be recognized, and others are not affected by it. }{\i\cf2 
After having been once injured, they are ever after very susceptible to the poison}{
. Even passing to the leeward of a bush on a windy day, or through the smoke of a fire in which it is burning, will "bring the poison to the surface" again. So poisonous is it, that it poll
utes the air where it grows. Children, and even grown-up people, who are gathering berries, or other-wise approaching its vicinity, are often badly poisoned. }{\i\cf2 
Their faces are frequently swelled until their eyes are shut; the neck, hands, and arms covered with inflamed vesicles, the cuticle highly inflamed, and not unfrequently constitutional symptoms are observed, resembling those of "milk sickness}{
." On breaking a stem of the Rhus a milky fluid exudes, which is exceedingly poisonous, and if applied to the sk
in, will produce effects like that of nitrate of silver. A black welt is produced, which in a few hours becomes sore, destroys the cuticle, which sloughs off, and upon healing leaves a circular cicatrix, }{\fs18\cf2 [67].\{al\}
\par }{Those persons who are constitutionally lia
ble to the influence of this poison, experience from it a train of symptoms very similar to those which result from exposure to the Rhus vernix; these consist in itching, redness, and tumefaction of the affected parts, particularly of the face, succeeded 
b
y blisters, suppuration, aggravated swelling, heat, pain, and fever; when the disease is at its height, the skin becomes covered with a crust, and the swelling is so great as in many instances to close the eyes and almost obliterate the features; the symp
t
oms begin in a few hours after exposure, and are commonly at the height on the fourth or fifth day, after which desquamation begins to take place, and the distress, in most instances, to diminish. Sometimes the eruption is less general, and confines itsel
f to the part which has been exposed to contact with the poison. The symptoms of this malady, though often highly distressing, are rarely fatal. I have, nevertheless, been told of cases in which death appeared to be the consequence of this poison, }{

to a pea, were crowded together, and when these broke and dried, eczematous crusts remained. Sufficient irritation carried the inflammation on to ulceration}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [96].\{al\}
\par }{I felt on the ears and hands an itching similar to the bites of insects; it extended over
 the face, principally around the eyes, on the cheek-bone, and around the brow; by degrees, in the space of twenty-four hours, all these parts were perceptibly swollen, and on the ears the swelling was accompanied with a considerable redness (after eleven
 
days). Took a dose of Rhus. All the symptoms became much worse, so as to occasion great pain; similar symptoms were manifested on the parts of the body that were covered, more especially on the scrotum, which became red first on the left side, then all ov
e
r, became much swollen, and caused intense itching; they then extended to the left thigh, only the latter did not swell, but became covered with red spots, with a burning itching, quite insupportable, much more painful than the stings from nettles; at las
t
, yielding to the insufferable itching, I rubbed myself slightly with the hand to procure a little relief. On the thirteenth day I was so changed by the swelling that I astonished every one; my hands, but only on the dorsal side and on the first phalanges
 
of the fingers, were much swollen, and the swelling ascended even to the middle of the forearm, so that the wrist of my shirt cut me; there was also observed a great number of isolated vesicles, filled with a white fluid, which were doubly as painful when
 
scratched; the itching and red spots on the left leg extended also to the left arm. The swelling and itching on the ears and face diminished, and ceased entirely up to the sixteenth day or thereabouts; the ears became white, and desquamation took place; t
h
e hands, more especially the right, were still swollen, but no vesicles were any longer produced; on the contrary, at the lower extremities, the symptoms continued to be developed; on the left leg the red spots descended beyond the ankle, which also began
 
to become swollen; on the inner side of the two thighs, as also at the external sides of the right thigh, there were formed red patches, which were extremely itchy, similar to patches of measles, but larger, and without a rounded form. I had to do violenc
e
 to myself not to scratch, for every time I yielded to the temptation I was punished for it, and yet I would willingly have continued. It was only on the twentieth day that the improvement in the symptoms was at all perceptible; the swelling of the right 
h
and disappeared; however, the itching continued, though less burning. Some days later the spots which served as the seat for the vesicles scaled off; the desquamation extended gradually over the whole external surface of the hand, as if the epidermis had 
been burned; I observed no such appearance on the legs. At the present time (the twenty-eighth day) this symptom also has almost disappeared; however, I always feel an itching in this hand, just as in the left leg, which was swollen, }{\fs18\cf2 [75].\{al

\par }{His hands, es
pecially the lateral surfaces of the fingers, were thickly covered with vesicles, and his face and genitals were badly swollen. The following day the eruption appeared upon the arms and about the thighs and abdomen, and continued to spread for several day
s

ules and vesicles, and by moist excoriations. The genitals were enormously distended by \'9cdema, and the scrotum was running with serum. The arms and legs were also \'9c
dematous, and largely occupied by fields of the peculiarly characteristic vesicles of the aff
ection. The patient was of a highly nervous temperament, and suffered tortures from the severe itching which accompanied the eruption. The skin was so universally irritable, that no clothes could be worn for forty-eight hours, when the affection was at it
s height, and a sheet or blanket was the only covering during this time. Sleep, without powerful anodynes, was impossible for several nights in succession, }{\fs18\cf2 [84].\{al\}
\par }{The following morning he complained of tiresome itching on the hands and wrists. On the fou

h
ich continued to enlarge for seven or eight days, and became filled with yellowish serum, indicating a bad form of erysipelas; in spite of bloodletting, baths, emollient fomentations, and soothing drinks, the head swelled to such an extend that he was una
b
le to see for twenty-four hours in consequence of the enormous swelling of the eyelids; the itching then spread all over the body, chiefly on the hairy scalp and the privates, which he tore to pieces with scratching. After ten days these symptoms went off

 itching more or less troublesome, made their appearance upon various other parts of the body; the face was universally sprinkled with them, but these were extremely small; the fluid which they contained was always limpid, and without any application, exc
e
pt that of cold water every morning, they entirely disappeared in two or three days. About the seventh or eighth day the itching, the inflammation, and the spread of the vesicles appeared to be nearly at their height. At this period, and for some days aft

rwards, the greater part of the forearm and about one-third of the arm were swelled to nearly twice the natural thickness; the itching was intolerable, and the vesicles, in general, were no longer filled with a limpid fluid, but contained a thick matter o

 pus very similar to that of small-pox, and strongly adhering to the linen. On the ninth day I perceived a swelling in the axillary gland of the right arm, which was that to which the lacteous juice was applied, and which was chiefly affected; the swellin
g
 rapidly increased until it became of the size of a hen's egg, and on the second day of its appearance it had almost entirely vanished. From the period that the swelling was at its height to its entire disappearance, the itching was almost universal, and 
m
uch more insupportable than it was before. In fifteen days from the time that the poison was first applied to my arm, all the disagreeable symptoms had ceased; the vesicles had almost entirely disappeared; a desquamation of the affected parts had taken pl

\par }{In June, 1871, she suffered very severely from a burning and itching eruption covering her entire face, neck, both mamm\'e6

 broke out, appearing simultaneously in all the localities attacked the previous year. It began with swelling, redness, intense burning, and itching. During the subsequent twenty-four hours, the inflamed surface became densely covered with very minute ves

\par }{The juice became dark on exposure, and concreted on the palm and wrists, forming dar

on the flexor surface of the right wrist. On the top of each blister there remained adherent a portion of the black concentrated juice, and there was some redness around the vesications, but no pain. Four or five days subsequently the other wrist became s
i
milarly affected, and about the same time the redness began to slowly spread up both forearms. Nothing further was noticed until the seventeenth day after the exposure, when he was obliged to give up work in consequence of the swelling and stiffness of th
e
 forearms, and about the same time the redness began to spread slowly up both forearms. On examining the patient I found the skin on the flexor surface of both forearms swollen, and of a florid red color, like that of erysipelas; and the red surface was c
o
vered with small transparent vesicles each about the size of a pin's head, closely set together. The vesicles closely resembled those of eczema or the minute inflammatory vesications produced by the application of turpentine. Both forearms were considerab
l
y swollen, and felt stiff to the patient. Some of the black spots, formed by the dried acrid juice, were still seen on the palms of the hands and on the adjoining parts of the wrists. The skin of the (upper) arms was natural. The face, though less affecte
d than the forearms, and not vesicated, was swollen and erythematous, the eyelids being puffy and partially closed. The trunk of the body was untouched, but the skin of the penis and scrotum was red, \'9c
dematous and painful, and there were scattered spots of 
inflamed and slightly elevated skin on the inner surface of both thighs. The inflamed portions of the skin were the seat of pain, sometimes of a numbing character, sometimes stinging like the irritation of nettles. The pain was worse at night, owing to th
e
 heat, but it was not severe anywhere except in the forearms. During the course of the following day the red patches extended up the arms, and also down the thighs as far as the knees, while some scattered spots remained over the pubes. Next day (27th) th
e
 swelling and redness of both face and arms were diminishing, and the vesicles on the forearms were drying up into scabs, but the erythematous eruption on the thighs continued to spread downwards to the legs, and upwards on the trunk of the body. On the 2
9
th, at noon, the abdomen was found covered with irregularly-shaped patches of inflamed skin, which had extended from the pubes upwards as far as the hypochondria. At the margins of the large patches there were numerous detached small reddish spots, like t
h
e eruption at the outset of measles, the larger patches resembling the continuous rash of scarlet fever. On the 31st the redness had extended to the back, while anteriorly the skin, from the pubes to the clavicles, was marked with inflamed patches and spo
t
s, the region of the sternum alone being unaffected. The legs were almost entirely covered with eruption. There was no vesication on any of these parts. But while the eruption was thus spreading on the lower half of the body, the upper half was recovering
. Thus the forearms were now nearly well; the redness and swelling were gone, only a few vesicles remaining on the backs of the hands and between the fingers. The face had nearly the natural appearance, very little desquamation being observable, }{

\par Extreme languor (third day), }{\fs18\cf2 [103].\{al\}
\par }{Itching burning (especially in the morning), and vesicular eruption on the hands and wrist and about the eyes, with smartin
g and redness of the eyes, and photophobia twenty-four hours after gathering, but commencing about eighteen hours previously. Headache through the eyes and temples, with dulness and sleepiness thirty to thirty-six hours after, in the afternoon. Secretion 
of urine more copious and rather pale. Next day, itching, burning, and extension of the vesicular eruption around the eyes, upper lids, supercili\'e6
, mouth, and external orifice of the ears, and drowsiness and dulness of spirits in the afternoon. Headache, sl
ight photophobia, and obscured vision at times, as well as on the previous day. Itching of the scalp. Tongue more furred and appetite not as good. After midnight, on the beginning of the third day, pain, colic, rumbling, and griping in the bowels during r
e
pose, with sulphuretted eructations, and discharge of flatus. (Had eaten custard at noon before). Two or three years ago when similarly affected from preparing some, had loose evacuations in the morning for several days; recurring, in addition to the coli
c
 and cutting pains in the abdomen. Rather copious secretion of palish urine continues. Rheumatic pain in the lumbar region and through the hips. Nausea, want of appetite, and loathing of food on rising in the morning, and colic and griping, etc., continue
,
 but better after moving about during the day. Tongue still more coated. Itching of the hands and face still continues, and more extended. Took a dose of Bryonia, and it is proper to remark, that I inhaled Bryonia rather freely the evening of the exposure
,
 otherwise I would probably have suffered still more, as I had done two or three times in as many years before. Fourth day, symptoms all materially relieved excepting the eruption, which is more extended. Fifth, sixth, and seventh days, first eruption dry
ing up, but coming out on new spots. From a boy up to 1842, I had always been able to handle this and the Rad., and be among it, without experiencing any inconvenience, }{\fs18\cf2 [99].\{al\}
\par }{All the sufferings were aggravated at 2 A.M., gradually improving till about 10 A.M., and growing worse towards evening, }{\fs18\cf2 [101]}{.\line 
\par }{\b\cf6 \'b0\'b0\'b0\'b0SKIN.}{
\par 45_.
\par The eruption made its appearance in the afternoon, after the second cup, of a bright redness, and an intense burning sensation; it soon covered the whole body from scalp to toes; the head and
 limbs badly swollen; the eruption, first smooth, soon assumed a minute vesicular appearance, which in places, ran together, forming small bulbs filled with serum. On the fifth day the vesicles began to dry up, followed by a desquamation of the cuticle, w
ith intense itching; the cervical glands were swollen and sore to the touch when the eruption made its appearance; swelling of the eyelids, with \'9cdema of the upper lid, }{\fs18\cf2 [101].\{al\}
\par }{Sunday (the third day) there was an eruption of itching red papules behind each ear and on the neck. On Monday these papules enlarged and became more numerous, and the eyelids were red and \'9c
dematous. Face was red and swelled; the cervical glands became tumid and slightly tender. On rising from bed she fainted, and again later in th
e day syncope came on. On Tuesday the rash had extended all over the face, over the hands, between the toes, and thighs. The itching was becoming more and more intolerable, and partook of a burning character. About the fifth day from their first appearanc
e
, the papules had become vesicles, which rapidly coalesced on the face and burst, emitting and acrid serum, which, on drying, formed a crust, so dense as to make the movement of the facial and buccal muscles painful. The nose and lips were much swollen. T
he \'9c
dema of the eyelids was so great as to close up the left eye entirely and the right partially. The burning and itching were somewhat relieved after the breaking of the vesicles. The acute stage was now over (six days after the commencement), but the cra
cking of the crusts over the face, etc., occasioned such a disfigurement that the lady was confined to the house for a fortnight more; by that time all traces of the skin erysipelas had disappeared, only an unusual irritability (to flannel, etc.) of the i
n
tegument remained, and a hypersensitiveness to cold air. After a second exposure to the shrub several months later, there was very intense erysipelas of the face for four or five days. The next month there were two attacks. Five months later there was ano
ther attack, without fresh exposure, shortly after taking a bath rather too hot. The vesicles that appeared during the first two days were scattered and few, and strongly resembled the eruption of chicken-pox, }{\fs18\cf2 [103].\{al\}
\par }{A fifth attack came on after taking 
a bath rather too hot, five months after exposure. One of the earliest symptoms was the peculiar rheumatism of Rhus, affecting the legs chiefly, a stiffness of all the joints on first moving them; aching pains in the joints, constant feeling of lameness i
n the legs. This rheumatism continued nearly three weeks, }{\fs18\cf2 [103].\{al\}
\par }{A man was poisoned in California, in September, went back to the Eastern States, had an annual eruption for six successive years, and during the seventh attack was carried off by a pneumon
ia, which would not have been fatal probably to him when in his ordinary health, }{\fs18\cf2 [102].\{al\}
\par }{Within eighteen hours his face had become red, inflamed, and hideously swollen, his eyes being both quite closed, and the itching and burning were most distressing. The local erysipelas and \'9c
dema lasted one week, the papules developing into vesicles, which became confluent, and followed the same course as in the lady's case. The general eruption extended over the whole body, and did not disappear for five weeks. A sa
lt-and-water lotion relieved this the first attack, but failed in two subsequent attacks, }{\fs18\cf2 [105].\{al\}
\par }{Her face was so swollen, blistered, and mottled, that her best friends could not have recognized her; so badly were the integuments of the eyes swollen, that she could not see. She had a high fever and much burning-smarting pain over the face and head, 
}{\fs18\cf2 [100].\{al\}
\par }{The day after he had last been among these bushes, heat and itching of the scrotum and inner adjacent surface of the thighs commenced, worse on the hairy parts. Next day the characteristic papules, on a base of diffused redness and \'9c
dema, appeared on the forehead and neck, rapidly spreading in all directions, and accompanied with heat, itching, and burning, but with very little general pyrexia. The i
tching was relieved by cold, but aggravated by heat, warmth, and rubbing or scratching, }{\fs18\cf2 [104]}{.\line

\par }{The following, taken from the original, is deemed worthy of insertion, in place of the fragmentary reference in volume i.
\par Das silber, Arzn. Betrachet. Dr. Krahmer, Halle, 1845, p. 84. Quoted experiments of Schachert, Diss. de usu Argenti nitrici intermo, Regimont, 1837.
\par He took 1/8 grain of Nitrate of silver in distilled water, frequently repeating the dose; slight burning in the stomach. Afterwards took 1/4 grain,
 then 1/2 grain, daily. The burning sensation in the stomach became quite severe. The tongue showed in various places a dark-bluish color, and in the stomach there was a sensation of increased warmth and some nausea; these symptoms disappeared after takin
g
 food. The stools and pulse were not affected. Some time after this, Schachert increased the doses to a grain, which he took an hour and a half after dinner. The burning in the throat was very severe. The tongue showed for several days a dirty-brown color
. The warmth in the stomach increased to nausea and retching, without actual vomiting, and after a few hours gave place to a persistent, periodically aggravated sensation of compression in the stomach. Towards evening diarrh\'9c
a set in, and continued during t
he next day, with relief of the pressure in the stomach. The evacuations seemed thin, but their color was normal. In addition to these sometimes there was a distressing dull headache, seated especially in the forehead, and associated with a certain prostr
a
tion and restlessness. Changes in respiration, pulse, and secretion of urine were not marked. On the third day all the symptoms of the drug action had disappeared. Eight days afterwards Schachert took 1 1/2 grain in the morning fasting. He experienced nau
sea and efforts to vomit. He felt unwell through the day and suffered from dull headache.
\par }{\i\cf2 Krahmer's experiments on himself, p.}{ 119.
\par When I began my experiment I was quite well and strong, but afterwards was sick, and my stomach suffered for many days after 
I had discontinued the use of the silver; I frequently had heartburn, from which I had never before suffered, though these symptoms gradually disappeared. But in their place there soon appeared an almost uninterrupted neuralgic pain in the left infra-orbi
t
al region, which for some moments became most terribly severe, and lasted with interruptions the whole following winter. At the same time the action of the heart became irregular, and the beats at times omitted, when I had a distinct disagreeable sensatio
n in the chest. To this was added a constant sensation of faintness in the pr\'e6
cordial region. I found that on turning my attention to the action of the heart its irregularity became more marked, but on moving about freely the sensation at times entirely dis
appeared. Upon my disposition these symptoms had no effect. The paroxysms of anxiety at the heart were not associated with it. Physical movement was uninterrupted, only sudden violent muscular action, as for example, jumping or rapid running upstairs, or 
a
fter emotional excitement, caused violent palpitation; the disagreeable sensations were least marked in a horizontal position, and in the evening in bed. Sleep was rarely disturbed by palpitation. Towards the end of the winter the attacks diminished in in
t
ensity. Physical signs of anything abnormal about the heart were entirely wanting, as I was assured by an eminent medical friend. The next summer all morbid symptoms had entirely disappeared. That these changes in my condition were really the results of t
he silver I have no manner of doubt; there is no other explanation of them, and I make this communication in hope that my colleagues, who may have the opportunity to make similar observations, may be able to verify them.
\par In observing the action of silver I 
have endeavored as far as possible to pay attention not only to all the subjective, but also to all the objective symptoms; changes in the pulse, temperature, and character of the urine have been especially observed. I lacked the proper apparatus to ascer
tain the amount of carbonic acid eliminated by respiration.
\par My average pulse in the morning after rising was 66; at noon, soon after returning from my visits, 72; and in the evening, ordinarly 68. A strict milk diet for more than two weeks had no effect upon the character of the pulse. My temperature is from 29.6
\'b0 to 30\'b0R. I examined the urine, keeping account of the total amount, specific gravity, amount of water, quantity of uric acid, urea, and incinerated salts.
\par In order to have correct data, I examined 
the urine from the 6th to the 19th of October. I rise at 6 A.M., breakfast on two cups of coffee, am busy reading or writing till 9, visit patients till 1, then take dinner; work till 5 in my office, make evening visits, take supper at 8, go to bed about 
11. Noon and evening I usually drink a glass of beer or wine. From October 19th to November 6th, I kept a very strict regular diet; took daily 2293.7 grams of fresh milk, and 418. grams of white bread.
\par October 26th, I took 0.1 grain crystals four times; 27t
h same; 28th, 0.2 grain; 29th, the same; 30 th; 0.3 grain four times; 31st, 0.4 grain four times; November 1st, 0.5 grain four times; 2d, 0.6 grain four times; 3d, 0.8 grain four times; 4th, 1 grain four times; 5th, 6/5 grain four times.
\par A consequence of t
he strict diet was that the stools, which are usually regular, were affected, so that October 21st, one was evacuated only after violent and painful effort, and on the 23d there was no voluntary stool. After several hour's effort to evacuate hard f\'e6
ces, I 
took 1 ounce of castor oil. In the evening there was a hard painful stool, and the next morning a pasty stool. On the 25 th, repeated the oil, and the night of the 25th and 26th, took in addition an extra 1/2 ounce of the oil. On the 28th again took oil, 
also on the 29th, and from the 29th to the 2d of November, I took daily a teaspoonful of castor oil, so that the stools continued without great difficulty. After November 3d, I did not require the oil, because the large amount of silver nitrate kept the f
\'e6c
es soft. November 2d, my stomach began to suffer. At noon, after taking milk and bread, I experienced a pressing sensation of fulness in the epigastric region. November 3d, especially towards evening, the whole abdomen was very tense. November 4th, there 
w
as violent headache, and I could scarcely force myself to take the necessary amount of nourishment. The night was restless; I could not remain in bed after 4 o'clock. November 5th, I was still more averse to food, though the taste was natural and the tong
u
e not coated. Through the day I had violent headache. The following night was very restless. I rose at 3 o'clock, and took nothing but a glass of milk before noon. The headache was very violent. In the afternoon, after passing the last quantity of urine f
o
r examination, I took two cups of strong black coffee, after which I felt quite relieved. Supper was relished, but the next day I could take but a very small quantity of food on account of heart-burn. The action of the silver seemed to cause a sensation o
f
 satiety, and my stomach seemed to need less nourishment than in a state of health. In the morning I took 1/4 grain in a pill form with white sugar dry on the tongue. I immediately experienced a very bitter taste, followed by warmth in the tip of the tong
u
e, then in the pharynx, after which these two symptoms seemed to alternate with each other. I drank a little distilled water, which was followed by slight eructations, and a sensation of catarrh in the fauces and larynx. At noon, before dinner, I dissolve
d
 my dose in a drachm of distilled water. I experienced a sweetish taste and feeling of warmth in the mouth. Three hours after dinner took 1/2 grain in distilled water. The sensations were the same as before, but perhaps more severe. The scraping sensation
 in the pharynx provoked hawking and coughing. After a quarter of an hour I had a sensation of warmth between the scapul\'e6
 and sternum, which gradually became a pinching and slight pressure in the epigastric region. This was followed by tasteless eructations
. The next morning I took 1 grain in water, and had only a very bitter taste. After ten minutes there was only very transient nausea.
\par The relation of the urea to the solid constituents in my case is somewhat less than the average given by Simon in his }{\i\cf2 Handbook}{
. I had an average of 26.3 per cent. of urea, perhaps dependent upon the peculiarity of my diet, which is generally vegetable. Under the effects of the milk diet this per cent. rose to 37.6, and the amount of uric acid became quite small, which dur
ing my ordinary diet was 0.6, but was now reduced to 0.045; the amount of solid constituents was not essentially changed by the silver, nor was the amount of urea perceptibly changed; the average was 33.5 per cent; the whole amount daily excreted was 1.5 
g
ram. Uric acid entirely disappeared from the urine under the influence of the silver. The amount of incinerated salts during the milk diet remained very constant. After several days' use of the silver it rose slightly. In the evening of November 6th, ther
e was found 0.127 gram of pure silicic acid; so far as I know no analysis of urine has shown a like amount of silicic acid. No changes were noticed in the circulation or temperature. Silver was not found in the urine.

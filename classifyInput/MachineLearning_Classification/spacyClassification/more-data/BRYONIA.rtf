t
egument over parotid being made tense, for such tension caused pain sufficient to prevent sleep; the parotid gland was especially sensitive to the touch of the steel bows of the glasses, which also caused violent burning, that lasted several seconds after
 
removing them; this symptom, which did not disappear during the whole duration of the Bryonia ear-trouble, was at first ascribed simply to pressure, but he became convinced that the burning pain was just as violent from a light touch upon the parotid with
 
the steel as from severe pressure; the region of the parotid gland was somewhat more distended, and tearing pains attacked two teeth in the lower jaw (he had never suffered from toothache except when proving Colocynth); the next night was almost sleepless

als violent stitches pierced the auditory apparatus; cracking in the internal ear when blowing the nose, hawking, etc.; the region of the parotid gland greatly distended and painful even to slight pressure; burning and sensation of warmth lasted for some

 the pain was completely relieved for a time, but returned after a few minutes with the same intensity. The next morning a severe chill attacked the back and extremities, with small, accelerated, depressed pulse; he remained in bed and took, morning and e

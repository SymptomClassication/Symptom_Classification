 in bed, his whole frame being in a state of complete rigidity. The limbs were rigid, and the fingers clenched. During the spasms, evident relief was afforded by forcible extension of the body. In the intervals there were constant twitches of the extremit

 more especially of the limbs, with extreme pain in all the parts affected. The spasm was at times continued during three or four minutes, and then succeeded by some quick change of position or long succession of convulsive motions. The muscles of the bac

most vehement attack soon followed, in which the whole body was extended to the utmost, and she was rigidly stiff from head to foot; insomuch that, with all the force I chose to exert, I could not bend the thigh on the pelvis to replace her in her seat; f

anic state of the whole muscular system returned from merely tapping any part of the body with the finger. She was seized, just two hours and a half from the time of taking the poison, with one the most awful convulsions it is possible to conceive. Her fa

\par }{Shortly afterwards they partook of their tea, and felt no ill effects for 
rather more than forty minutes. Dr. T. then rose from his chair to go into the garden, and proceeded as far as his parlor door when he felt the first symptoms, and exclaimed, "Hold me! hold me!" Mrs. T. sprung from her seat and ran to his assistance, but 
before she got to him, she also, as she afterwards termed it, "was fixed." The symptoms were most violent. Dr. T. in convulsive agonies, but perfectly calm and collected. They were both, as it were, fixed to the chairs in which they sat.
\par The symptoms in bot
h were exactly similar. As the convulsions came on, the heads were drawn back, there was a spasmodic clenching of the teeth, the heels fixed to the ground, and the eyes as if protruding from their sockets, and both, curiously enough, kept exclaiming, "Hol
d me! hold me!" although there was a person on either side of each. Dr. T. afterwards told me "that if I had set fire to a bundle of straw under him, he did not think he could have moved," although at the same time he kept crying, "Hold me!" }{\fs18\cf2

\par }{When his friends had gone, he went into the bedroom; stood in a reverie, which seemed to last three or four hours, looking through the half opened door into the sitting-roo

\par }{Attention principally occupied by an hallucination that }{\i\cf2 time was indefinitely prolonged}{. Seemed to himself to have sat there for hours, and when he tried to think }{\i\cf2 why}{
 he did so, nearly lost control over his reason, and a rapid whirl of confused and irrelevant thoughts prevented his fixing attention on any one point for a moment, and it was only the effort of checking himself when falling which recalled
 him to himself, and then he suddenly recollected "}{\i\cf2 Cannabis Indica}{" but when did he take it? Surely it was yesterday, last week, days ago. On summoning his servant, it seemed a few weeks before he came, }{\fs18\cf2 [15].\{al\}
\par }{His calculation of the time he enjoyed the dreams was about three hundred years, the fact being that only a quarter of an hour had elapsed, }{\fs18\cf2 [28].\{al\}

\par }{It seemed as though I was transparent; the fire in the grate seemed to shine through me, and to warm the marrow of the bones. I felt the blood course in my veins, and everything within me trembled with the most extreme pleasure, }{\fs18\cf2 [24].\{al\}

\par }{His body seemed to him to become transparent, and he imagined he saw within his breast the hashish he had eaten in the form of an emerald, from which issued millions of little sparks, }{\fs18\cf2 [28].\{al\}

\par }{He seems to be 
the subject of the strangest transformations; now he is a huge saw, and darts up and down, while planks fly off on either side of him in utter completeness; and then he is a bottle of soda-water, running to and fro; then a huge hippopotamus; the a giraffe

\par }{He seems to himself to be transformed into a vegetable existence, as a huge fern, and to be surrounded by clouds of music and perfume, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{He laughs immoderately and involuntarily at the impression that his leg was a tin case filled with s
tair-rods, which he hears rattle as he walks. Then suddenly the other leg seems to extend its length till he is raised some hundreds of feet into the air, and on this he is compelled to hop as he is walking with his friend, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{His eyelashes became indefinitely prolonged, and began to roll as gold threads upon small ivory wheels, which revolved with great velocity, }{\fs18\cf2 [28].\{al\}
\par }{His voice seems strange, as if not his own, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{All impressions on the senses are exceedingly exaggerated, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{It seemed to him as though he was upon the ridge of a mountain, that he must climb a steep ascent over the naked rock to the top of the mountain, }{\fs18\cf2 [20].\{al\}
\par }{He imagines, while walking with his friend by a small stream, that it is the Nile, and he the traveller Bruce, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}

\par }{Fancies, on opening his bedroom door, that he sees numberless diabolical imps, with bloody faces and immense black eyes, which so terrify him that he sinks on his knees, a cold sweat breaks out on his body, his
 heart beats violently, he thinks he will suffocate, and cries loudly for help; suddenly one of the imps commences playing on a hand-organ and making such grotesque grimaces that he bursts into fits of laughter, }{\fs18\cf2 [1].\{al\}
\par }{On the wall of the room, at a great
 distance, a monstrous head was spiked up, which commenced a succession of grimaces of the most startling but ludicrous character. Its ferociously bearded under-jaw extended indefinitely, and then the jaw shooting back, the mouth opened from ear to ear.

\par The nose spun out into absurd enormity, and the eyes winked with the rapidity of lightning, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Thrown into "unbearable horror" by the falling upon him of a "shower of soot from heaven," }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{All the events of his past life, even those long forgot
ten, and those the most trivial, were thrown in symbols from a rapidly revolving wheel, each of which was recognizes as an act of his life, and each came in the order of sequence the act it indicated occupied in history, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{He has ludicrous visions of old and wrinkled females, who are found to be composed of knit yarn, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Illusions of the senses. He hears voices, and be most sublime music. He sees visions of beauty and glory that can only be equalled in Paradise. Landscapes of sublimest beauty
, with profusion of flowers of most brilliant colors, in contrast, to afford the greatest delight. Architecture of magnificent beauty and grandeur, and all giving a consciousness of happiness for the time, without mixture, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Vision of a silent army passed him in the street, in the evening, when walking, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{When walking in the open air, the plain is suddenly expanded and covered with a band of Tartars, who rush along in mad haste, their caps streaming with plumes and horsehair, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{While walking in the street, the houses suddenly become movable and take to nodding, bowing, and dancing in the most remarkable manner, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{His familiar acquaintance is mistaken for a Chinese mandarin, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{When walking in the street, he suddenly see
s the muffled figure of a man start from the wall. His appearance is such as to excite the utmost horror. "Every lineament of his face was stamped with the records of a life black with damning crime. It glared on me with a ferocious wickedness and a stony
 despair. I seemed to grow blasphemous in looking at him, and in an agony of fear turned to run away," }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Suddenly awoke, after midnight, and found himself in a realm of the most perfect clarity of view, yet terrible with an infinitude of demoniac sh
adows. Beside the bed, in the centre of the room, stood a bier, from whose corners drooped the folds of a heavy pall, and on it a fearful corpse, whose livid face was distorted with the pangs of assassination. Every muscle was tense, the finger-nails pier
c
ed the dead man's palm by the force of his dying clench. Two tapers at the head and two at the feet made the ghastliness of the bier more luminously unearthly, and a smothered laugh of derision from some invisible watcher mocked the corpse, as if triumpha
nt demons were exulting over their prey, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{"Then the walls of the room began slowly to glide together, the ceiling coming down, the floor ascending, like the captive's cell which was doomed to be his tomb. Nearer and nearer I was borne toward the co
rpse. I shrunk back; I tried to cry out, but speech was paralyzed. The walls came closer and closer. Presently my hand lay on the dead man's forehead. I was stifled in the breathless niche, which was all the space still left to me. The stony eyes stared u
p into nine, and again the maddening peal of fiendish laughter rang close beside my ear. Now I was touched on all sides by the walls of the terrible press; then came a heavy crush, and I felt all sense blotted out in darkness," }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}

\par }{"I awakened; the co
rpse was gone, but I had taken is place on the bier. The room had now grown into a gigantic hall, whose roof was framed of iron arches. Pavement, walls, cornice were all iron, and a thrill from them seemed to say this iron is a tearless fiend. I suffered 
f
rom the vision of that iron as from the presence of a giant assassin. Then there emerged from the sulfurous twilight the most horrible form -a fiend, also of iron, white-hot, and dazzling with the glory of the nether penetralia. A face that was the incarn
a
tion of all malice and irony looked on me with a glare, withering from its intense heat, but more from the wickedness it symbolized. Beside him another demon rocked a cradle framed of bars of iron, and candescent with a heat fierce as the fiends. And now 
a
 chant of blasphemy, so fearful that no human thought has ever conceived of it, from the demons, till I grew intensely wicked by hearing it. The music accorded with the thought, and with is clangor mixed the maddening creak of the forever oscillating crad
l
e, until I felt driven to a ferocious despair. Suddenly, the nearest fiend thrust a pitchfork of white-hot iron into my side, and hurled me into the fiery cradle. I lay unconsumed, tossing from side to side by rocking of the fiery engine, and still the ch
ant of blasphemy, and the eyes of demoniac sarcasm smiled at me in mockery. 'Let us sing to him,' said one of the fiends, 'the lullaby of hell!'" }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{"Withered like a leaf in the breath of an oven, after millions of years, I felt myself tossed on the 
iron floor. Presently, I was in a colossal square, and surrounded by houses a hundred stories high. With bitter thirst, I ran to a fountain carved in iron, every jet of which was sculptured in mockery of water, and yet as dry as the ashes of a furnace. I 
c
alled for water, when every sash in all the hundred stories of that square flew up, and a maniac stood at every window, They gnashed at me, glared, gibbered, howled, laughed, horribly hissed, and cursed. Then I became insane at the sight, and leaping up a
nd down, mimicked them all," }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{From zenith to horizon an awful angel of midnight blackness floated. His face looked unutterable terrors into me, and his dreadful hands half-clenched above my head, as if waiting to take me by the hair. Across the fir
mament a chariot came like lightning, with wheels like rainbow suns. At its approach, the sable angel turned and rushed down into the horizon, that seemed to smoke as he slid through it, and I was saved, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{The scene then became theatrical, and he a
n actor, who improvised his tragedy and held his immense audience entranced. Suddenly, a look of suspicion came over every face. "In sought relief by turning from the pit to the boxes. The same stony glance met me still. Oh! they knew my secret, and at th
a
t instant one maddening chorus broke from the whole theatre, 'Hashish! Hashish! He has eaten Hashish!' I crept from the stage in unutterable shame. I crouched in concealment. I looked at my garments, and beheld them foul and ragged as a beggar's. From hea
d
 to foot I was the incarnation of squalidity. My asylum proved on the pavement of a great city's principal thoroughfare. Children pointed at me; loungers stood and searched me with inquisitive scorn. The multitude of man and beast all eyed me; the very st
ones in the street mocked me with a human raillery as I cowered against a side wall in my bemired rags," }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 Imagines some one calls him}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [1].\{al\}
\par }{He hears music of the sweetest and sublimest melody and harmony, and sees venerable bards with their harps, who play as if it were the music of heaven, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{In music, a single tone seemed like the most divine harmony, }{\fs18\cf2 [24].\{al\}
\par }{\b\cf2 Imagines he hears music; shuts his eyes, and is lost for some time in the most delicious thoughts and dreams}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [1].\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 He fancies he hears numberless bells ringing most sweetly}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [1].\{al\}
\par }{For fully two weeks after, when sitting in his office, in quiet summer afternoons, reading desultorily, he would hear most magnificent harmony, as if some master-hand were paying an organ,
 and using only the softer stops. There was this peculiarity about the hearing of the music, namely, one must be in a state of half reverie, and then the divine strains, soft and marvellously sweet, followed one another in a smoother legato than any human
 fingering ever accomplished. If one roused the attention and strained the ear, as if to be sure of catching every chord, }{\i\cf2 silence came at once}{, }{\fs18\cf2 [41].\{al\}
\par }{Heard the noise of colors, green, red, blue, and yellow sounds coming to him in perfectly distinct waves, }{\fs18\cf2 [28].\{al\}
\par }{After such experience of ecstasy as has already been described, when just emerging from a dense wood, he heard a hissing whisper, "Kill thyself! Kill thyself!" "I turned to see who spoke. No one was visible. The whisper was repeated with inten
ser earnestness; and now unseen tongues repeated it on all sides and in the air above me, 'The Most High commands thee to kill thyself'. I drew forth my knife, opened it, and placed it at my throat, when I felt the blow of some invisible hand strike my ar
m; my hand flew back at the force of the shock, and the knife went spinning into the bushes. The whispers ceased," }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{In his first experiment, the sensations it produced where those, physically, of exquisite lightness and airiness; mentally, of a wonderfully keen perception of the ludicrous in the most simple and familiar objects, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{Objects by which he was surrounded assumed such a strange and whimsical expression, became in themselves so inexpressibly absurd and comical, that he was provoked 
into a long fit of laughter. The hallucination died away as gradually as it came, leaving him overcome with a soft pleasant drowsiness, from which he sank into a deep refreshing sleep. }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{In his second experiment, the same fine nervous thrill (that 
he experience in his first experiment) suddenly shot through him. But this time it was accompanied by a burning sensation at the pit of the stomach, and instead of growing upon him with a gradual pace of healthy slumber, and resolving him, as before, into
 
air, it came with the inttensity of a pang, and shot throbbing along the nerves to the extremities of his body. It seemed to him as if he existed without form throughout a vast extent of space. His whole body seemed to expand, and the arch of his skull to
 
be broader than the vault of heaven. His sensations presented themselves to him a double form; one physical, and therefore, to a certain extent, tangible, and the other spiritual; and revealing itself in a succession of splendid metaphors. His physical fe
e
ling of being was accompanied by an image of an exploding meteor, not subsiding into darkness, but continuing to shoot from its centre or nucleus, which corresponded to the burning spot at the pit of his stomach, incessant coruscations of light, that fina
lly lost themselves in the infinity of space. His mind was crowded with a succession of visions, but all ending in the ludicrous, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{While he was most completely under the influence of the drug, he was perfectly conscious that he sat in the tower of 
Antonio's hotel, in Damascus, knew that he had taken Hashish, and that the strange, gorgeous, and ludicrous fancies which possessed him were the effects of it, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{He was conscious of two distinct conditions of being in the same moment, of which neit
her conflicted with the other. His enjoyment of the visions was complete and absolute, undisturbed by the faintest doubts of their reality; while, in some other chamber of his brain, reason sat coolly watching them, and heaping the liveliest ridicule on t
heir fantastic features, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{One set of nerves was thrilled with the bliss of the gods, while another was convulsed with unquenchable laughter at that very bliss. His highest ecstasies could not bear down and silence the weight of his ridicule, which,
 in its turn, was powerless to prevent him from running into other and more gorgeous absurdities. After awhile the visions became more grotesque than ever, but less agreeable; and there was a painful tension throughout his nervous system. He laughed until
 
his eyes overflowed profusely; every drop that fell immediately became a large loaf of bread, and tumbled upon the shopboard of a baker in the bazaar at Damascus. The more he laughed, the faster the loaves fell, until such a pile was raised about the bake
r that he could hardly see the top of his head, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{A fierce and furious heat radiated from the stomach throughout his system; his mouth and throat were as hard as though made of brass, and his tongue it seemed to him, was a bar of rusty iron. Althoug
h he seized a pitcher of water and drank long and deeply, his palate and throat gave no intelligence of his having drunk at all, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{About midnight his excited blood rushed through his frame
 with a sound like the roaring of mighty waters. It was projected into his eyes until he could no longer see; it beat thickly on his ears, and so throbbed on his heart, that he feared the ribs would give way under its blows. He tore open his vest, placed 
h
is hand over the spot, and tried to count the pulsations; but there were two hearts, one beating at the rate of a thousand beats a minute, and the other with a slow, dull motion. His throat he thought was filled to the brim with blood, and streams of bloo
d were pouring from his ears. After the visions were over, there arose a sensation of distress, which was more severe than pain itself, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{His throat was as dry as a potsherd, and his stiffened tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{About 3 o'clock the next morning, rather more than five hours after the Hashish had been taken, he sunk into a stupor. All the following day and night he lay in a state of blank oblivion, broken only by a single wavering gleam of consciousness, }{
\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{He arose, attempted to dress himself, drank two cups of coffee, and then fell back into the same deathlike stupor, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{On the morning of the second day, after a sleep of thirty hours, he awoke again to the world, with a system utterly prostrate and unstrung, and a brain clouded with the lingering images of his visions, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}
\par }{There was no taste in what he ate, no refreshment in what he drank, and it required a painful effort to comprehend what was said to him, and return a coherent answer, }{\fs18\cf2 [18].\{al\}

\par }{In about an hour and a half after taking I perceived a heaviness of the head, wandering of the mind, and apprehension that I was going to faint. I thence passed into a state of half-trance,
 from which I awoke suddenly and much refreshed. The impression was that of wandering out of myself; I had two beings, and there were two distinct, yet concurrent trains of ideas. Images came floating before me; not the figures of a dream, but those that 
s
eem to play before the eye when it is closed; and with those figures were strangely mixed the sounds of a guitar that was being played in an adjoining room; the sounds seemed to cluster in and pass away with the figures in the retina. The music of the wre
t
ched performance was heavenly, and seemed to proceed from a full orchestra, and to be reverberated through long halls of mountains, These figures and sound were again connected with metaphysical reflections, which, also, like the sounds, clustered themsel
v
es into trains of thought, which seemed to take form before my eyes, and weave themselves with the colors and sounds. I was following a train of reasoning; new points would occur, and concurrently there was a figure before me throwing out corresponding sh
o
ots, like a zinc tree; and then, as the moving figures reappeared, or as the sounds caught my ear, the other classes of figures came out distinctly, and danced through each other. The reasonings were long and elaborate, and though the impression of having
 
gone through them remains, every effort has been in vain to recall them. The following scene was described by me, and taken down at the time. A general commanding an army, and doubting whether he should engage the enemy, consulted the oracle. The oracle a
nswered: "Go with the fortune of C\'e6sar." He gave battle, and was beaten. His king ordered his head to be cut off; but the general accused the oracle. The king cried, "The oracle is not in fault; it did not tell you that you were C\'e6
sar. You were twice a fool
 to mistake its meaning, and your own worth." The general answered, "Then is the fault his who sent a fool to command his armies." "Nay," answered the king. "thou shalt not twist one phrase to thy benefit, and another to my loss." This scene seemed to pas
s
 before me, and in the region of Carthage, which was all familiar, though I had never been there. The general was an Abyssinian; the king a white man with black beard. The next time I tried it the only effect was to make me lose a night's rest (taken towa
r
d evening). The first time (taken in the morning) it had given me a double portion of sleep; on both occasions it enormously increased my appetite. It was followed by no depression. The first time I took it at half past four, and after that a liqueur-glas
s
 of caraway spirits, to hasten the effect. I did not feel cold, while those who were walking with me, and wrapped in mantles, were complaining of it. The came an unsteadiness of gait; not that of one who fears to fall, of one who tries to keep down, for I
 
felt as if there were springs in my knees, and was reminded of the story of the man with the mechanical leg, that walked away with him. I sat down to dinner at half past 6 o'clock. There was a glass between me and the rest of the company, and an inch or t
w
o interposed between me and whatever I touched. What I ate and how much did not matter; the food flowed like a river through me. There was a wind going by, blowing over the table and carrying away the sounds, and I saw the words tumbling over one another 
over the falls. }{\i\cf2 There was a dryness of the mouth, which was not thirst}{
. The dryness radiated from the back of the throat, opposite the nape of the neck. It was a patch of dark-blue color; the food, as it reached this point, pouring down, and taking the colo
r of the patch. I was under the impression that I described all this at the time, but was told that I would not say anything about myself, or describe what I experienced. I should have been relieved if some one present had been under he same influence. Th
e
 bursts of laughter to which I gave rise were not at all pleasing, except when they were excited by any observation I made which was not connected with myself. I never lost the consciousness of what was going on; there were always present the real objects
, as well as the imaginary ones; but at times I began to doubt which was which, and then I floated in strange uncertainty. It came by fits, with, I thought, hours of intervals, when only minutes could have elapsed, }{\fs18\cf2 [26].\{al\}
\par }{Their first sensations were of i
ntense astonishment at the circumstance that they found themselves no longer masters of their own acts, while they still remained lucid witnesses of all acts, however foolish. Here the difference between alcoholic inebriation and that from Hashish is stro
n
gly marked. They saw themselves committing absurdities of the most grotesque kind; leaping, beating time to nothing, moving their arms as if receiving electrical shocks, writing ridiculous words, and so forth, without any power on their par to prevent suc
h
 exhibitions; but yet standing, as it were, independently of them, as though they were merely subjects of observation exhibited from other persons than themselves. At first they had the sensation and appearance of feigning a state of exaltation which they
 did not feel, and which was even feigned with so much uncertainty and awkwardness that any one aiding in it would for a long time believe in its unreality. It is, nevertheless, an irresistible propensity, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{At one moment the intellect is obscure, a
nd loses itself in forgetfulness of the past; then it returns clear, and is able to form a judgement for a moment, and disapprove of any acts it may have before sanctioned, but only to be again involved in that state of automatic folly which is so peculia
r
 a phenomenon during Hashish intoxication. During the intervals of confusion or darkness, the lucid moments possess a power and comprehension truly marvellous, so that in a few seconds the most distinct and accurate picture of a range of life, including a
s
 much as forty years, may be recast and surveyed. The alternation from obscurity to lucidity is like the effect of a sea-wave; a lucid wave is followed by a dark overhanging wave on which the mind is shipwrecked, and carried with the sensation of a melanc
h
oly floating towards forgetfulness and oblivion, to be roused instantly by the passage over it once more of the wave of life and light. The dark waves chase each other so long as they continue, and the mind, unable to continue its thoughts and acts, but b
ending under a successive series of impressions, the shortest space of time seems to present the duration of an eternity, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{A seeming extraordinary slowness of time, which struck the observers in so singular a manner, and made them so impatient of d
elay, that they were continually recurring to their watches, and observing, with a kind of awe, how minutes were transformed into epochs. With this apparently interminable length of time, there seemed to occur a kind of forgetfulness, by which an act of t
h
e mind, taking place an interval before, or an impression received some time before, were in a manner forgotten; but, in a few brief moments they returned, or presented themselves, as it were, for the first time and in such manner, almost unaccountably re
peated themselves, and reproduced frequently, as now, the impressions they reinspired, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{There was noticed in the observers, so different themselves ordinarily in general character and temperament, a common docility and absence of susceptibility whi
ch was most remarkable. Thus one of them gave to another with whom he was but slightly acquainted a series of hard blows on the back, saying that he himself felt nothing of the Hashish, and asking whether the blows he inflicted were felt. On his part, he 
w
ho received the blows took them all in good humor, uttering no complaint, and seeming, in indeed, insusceptible of complaint. Again, one of them, who sat writing, submitted to receive the infliction of two sharp blows, boxes on the ears, and to have his p
e
n snatched out of his hand, without any expression of pain or even annoyance. Reproaches between them for having taken the drug never passed; but each, laughing all the time, tried often, in lucid intervals, to produce sickness. Such was the good humor th
a
t prevailed that each one mutually yielded up his own will and obeyed the other; the whole trio joyfully concurring in all that suggested itself to them, as withdrawing them from the idea of danger, and fully agreeing in particulars as to the sensations t
hey experienced, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{Was seized with melancholy, from which he could rouse himself only by imitating the movements and follies of the other. Then he had a great inclination to laugh, but kept himself free from the obvious action of the drug by going b
ehind his companions. Suddenly he perceived a change in his intellectual faculties, which appeared less obedient to his will, and feeling he should be worse, he began to register his thoughts of what happened to him. Scarcely had he began, than it seemed 
m
ore important to him to record the follies uttered by one of his companions. He soon felt himself, however, unable to continue, and his hands with difficulty traced unformed characters. Then becoming preoccupied with a scheme which scribblers might think 
t
he act of a madman, he with great difficulty wrote a short justification of his conduct in Milanese. He next began to feel a pleasing stupor; his head seemed to dilate, but without strain, gently! gently! He possessed the use of his senses of mind, but ev
ery occupation wearied him. He passively assisted in what was occurring around him, and unable to give any account of it or reason, was able to laugh at all or everything, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{After about a quarter of an hour, a weakness of his whole body came on, his
 legs would not support him, his arms became heavy, and he was seized with a kind of fainting similar to that which at times follows loss of blood. He was obliged to throw himself on the sofa, his limbs became rigid, he entirely lost his sensations, becom
i
ng cataleptic, and remained for a long time in this state. By degrees his senses partially returned, so that he was enabled to understand and retain some directions given to him, but he became insensible again, and when put to bed a very hot box placed at
 his feet, which were very cold, produced no impression. By degrees the insensibility or an\'e6
sthesia which had pervaded his whole body relaxed in the left half of his body, but remained perfect in the right. His consciousness, which had never entirely left h
im but for a few brief moments, by degrees returned to its natural state, so that he could recall what had occurred to him and reflect upon his condition. Again, an\'e6
sthesia extended all over his body, and now was added an automaton-like and rapid movement 
of the hands, one hand being pressed upon the breast, and rubbed actively on the back with the palm of the other hand; his head also ached, and he had a sensation of weakness. The an\'e6
sthesia gradually decreased, but the sensibility did not return universal
ly, nor steadily, there being frequent relapses. By turns the right arm or the leg, or the right half of the face, and then all these parts together, would seem petrified, so that he could not move them, and would then relax. As time went on these phenome
n
a were more frequently repeated in the head and face, the change being quick enough to give great pain; when suddenly the mass of his brain, all except a small portion, seemed changed to marble, and appeared to him to possess all the properties of such a 
s
ubstitution; his right eye, for a long time, retained the sensation of marbly hardness. These symptoms, now going, now returning, lasted more than thirty-six hours. The mind, meantime, had not remained idle, but during moments of returned consciousness as
s
isted as a spectator; ideas succeeded each other with such rapidity that they made a short space of time seem very long. These ideas, although more often scattered, had at times an intimate and long connection; thus every person who had ever assisted him 
h
e seemed to see for years and years performing all those long and varied series of acts, which might in reality have been performed during such a period, so that he felt convinced that all those years hat really passed. He also had a sort of hallucination
 
in which he seemed transported to a place whimsically made of brass; this, he thought, was the vestibule of Mohammed's paradise, and that he was denied entrance the it. On going out he found himself launched into space, and compelled to describe very rapi
dly a vast orbit, in a gloomy, painfully breathing, oppressive circle. This painful sensation lasted a long time, and was among the most disagreeable of the experiment, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{Was a prey to extreme loquacity and mobility of ideas; was continually preoccupied with solicitous impressions as to the fate of his companions, for whom he feared the dose of Hashish had been excessive, and might even prove poisonous.
\par After he had taken the drug about six hours he was seized with a sort of gesticulatory convulsions in the arms and legs, and by degrees his symptoms assumed the appearance of those which characterize hydrophobia. He was possessed with outbreaks of fear at
 
the sight of bright objects, at the sensation of every sharp little breath of air, or the approach of any one; but these exhibitions were momentary only, and he then paid no attention to what hat been previously exciting influences. He asked for water, an
d
 seized the cup with a trembling and convulsive hand, but carried it to his lips only to thrust it away without drinking, being unable even with the greatest effort to swallow a single draught. Upon this there succeeded a feeling of uneasiness, as though 
f
rom dryness of the throat, or rather a sensation that the tongue and throat were covered with a dry soft body. An urgent desire to be held, to be guided, and to be taken care of altogether, under the involuntary feeling that, if such protection were not b
e
stowed he should get out of bed (in which he was by this time laid) to commit some foolish act. Sensation of pressure at the back of the head, before the occurrence of convulsive movements, which changed into an unpleasant feeling of heat, then of cold, i
n
 consequence of which his hand were carried automatically to that spot, and there, as though there were a difficulty in detaching them. There was also a sensation of cramps in the calves of the legs, which rendered the movement of the legs impossible, or 
caused them to be distended, or to take a sudden jump, }{\fs18\cf2 [39].\{al\}
\par }{Four hours and a half after taking I was sitting with the family, playing the guitar, when one of the tunes, a rather solemn one, seemed suddenly to assume a more melodious character; it gradu
ally increased in grandeur bar after bar; sinking deep in my soul until I was wholly absorbed with it. The words died away and I still went on with the accompaniment; my mind carried the air, and all surrounding objects faded; I lived wholly in the music;
 
and a deep subdued joyous feeling, such as I never before felt, pervaded my whole being. At last I came to myself somewhat, and turned to the others and remarked that it was beautiful, and asked if they did not think so. They were much surprised at the qu
e
stion, and said it possessed very little merit. I was now surprised in my turn and began to argue its merits, offering to play it over. At this moment a strange crawling sensation commenced in my body, it extended to my limbs, down my arms, to my fingers'
 
ends, and up into my brain; it travelled slowly, yet so powerful was it that I was wholly overcome with surprise. I was a little alarmed at the feeling, but immediately the word "Hashish" passed through my mind. Ah! that was it, that was the enchanter tha
t
 made my music sound so sweet. I was glad to find it had not failed; I was reassured; it was undoubtedly the legitimate effect of the drug. All these things were very nice, but yet the thrill was a thing I had not expected, and another and another followi
n
g in close succession, I began to wish the last dose had been as ineffectual as the first. I commenced considering what was best to be done. I could not decide whether to sit still or go to my room. I tried to play, but an apparent ebullition in the air p
r
evented me from seeing the notes; the thrills were growing stronger every moment, and I concluded I had best leave the room lest I should do something foolish. I arose abruptly, and with guitar in one hand and music-stand in the other, I sallied forth to 
g
o down stairs. No sooner did I commence to move than the thrills increased; stronger and stronger they came, closer and closer they succeeded each other, until one ceased not until an almost overwhelming thrill gave notice of another's birth. In going dow
n
 stairs my mind ever and anon would wandering other matters and things, and when I recalled my thoughts to what was immediately before me I wondered to find myself still going down stairs. Then a feeling of dread uncertainty seized me, "Shall I ever reach
 
the bottom?" I doubted that I would, yet my reason told me I was going right; so I pressed on. I put my guitar away safely and this reassured me. I say reassured, because I had begun to doubt that any of the things around me had existence, but I reasoned 
t
hat I had succeeded in finding the guitar-box, and hence some things must exist, and, as I had seen one right, so it was likely all existed. Still I was uncertain that I maintained control of my faculties and motive powers; an intuitive assurance, however
,
 made me depend on them, and I determined to go quietly upstairs to my room; I went up very quietly; indeed, I seemed not to touch the steps; I trod the air as a swimmer treads water; my feet came near the steps but did not strike them. I reached my room,
 
but what to do now; it did not improve my condition. I determined to lie down until the thrills went off, which I thought would certainly be very soon, and then I expected other effects to follow. I threw myself on the bed, but immediately sprang to my fe
e
t again, for no sooner did I lie down than I thought of catalepsy being sometimes produced by the use of the drug; no, I must not lie down; I must keep my soul in my body by force of will, or perhaps it would never return, and I felt that it was trying to
 
wing itself away. As the extract was strong and so small an amount had produced so great an effect, I was afraid I had taken too great a dose, and became alarmed lest it should play me foul. The thrills had now become continuous, the commencing of each be
i
ng only known by an increase in their force; my heart and veins began to throb violently, the blood began to rush to my head, and I feared apoplexy. My tongue became coated with saliva, and I thought my body was dissolving into fluids. I spit from the win
d
ow. I afterwards thought it was foolish for me to do so as I might jump from the window, for I felt certain I did not possess the full command of my faculties. The uncertain aspect of things now increased, with the whole force of my reason seemingly unimp
a
ired. I could not convince myself the furniture in the room had other than an ideal existence; this feeling was so oppressive that I determined to seek the rest of the family. But how could I reach them? I was in another sphere; I had journeyed to a world
 
whose objects I could not realize, an uncertain world whose paths I did not know. An atmosphere surrounded my little world through which I could not pass; to break through the open doorway seemed as impossible as to wing my way through the ethereal region
s
 to the throne above. This was my station; here I must remain. A feeling of loneliness now overwhelmed me. I must seek the rest of the family. I hurled my body through the seemingly impenetrable though invisible barrier. On, on, I went, pushing my way thr
o
ugh a resistant atmosphere, or surrounding, which was a creation of my state. I know not how to express the feeling of this existence; there is no type among natural things to which I can compare it; an ethereal fluid it seemed to be, not dense as water n
o
r rare as air, yet it resisted, and I by force of will overcame it step by step. Here I noticed the two parts of my being acting separately; my will or spiritual existence was separate from my bodily existence, and spurring it onward, pushing it forwards 
a
nd using it much as an artificer uses a tool; onward it forced my body, seeming to exult in its supremacy. I cannot say whether my feelings at this time were more oppressed or buoyant, for while my mind seemed oppressed by the appearance of the objects al
o
ng my route, and fear of injury from the effect of the drug, my soul was exultant as though in a more congenial atmosphere, and glad of its partial disenthralment. I at last reached the room I sought; so long a time seemed to have elapsed since I had been
 
last there, that I did not expect to see the family there; it was impossible for me to keep any record of time, but it seemed as though I had been a long time away, and I expected to find the room tenantless; so certain was I that this would be the case t
h
at I was surprised to see them seated as I had left them. When I saw them, for an instant I thought they were really there, but it was only for an instant; they immediately assumed the same unreal appearance which other things held. I had determined that 
I
 would say nothing about my having taken the drug to the others for fear of frightening them, though I had told them I intended to take it. I did not doubt I could control my tongue, but. things about me seemed so unreal, and they were so silent, that I c
o
uld not restrain myself; I must speak to them, and see if they are really here, but. what should I say? I rummaged my brain for a question to ask, but could think of nothing but "Hashish." This I did not wish to speak of, but nothing else would come to my
 
mind; I must say something, for I could bear this feeling no longer. Then my reason told me it was best that they should know I had taken the drug, as they would then know how to treat me if any dangerous symptoms occurred, so I opened my mouth and said, 
"
I have taken Hashish." My voice appeared strange to me; it seemed as though another person spoke; I looked around; my words had made no impression on those around me; is it possible they can sit silent? I had thought they would have all sprang to their fe
e
t, so suicidal did it appear to me for one to take the drug. "I have forgotten," thought I; "they do not know the nature of the drug." I explained to them that it was the drug I had spoken to them of shortly before; I told them of its effects; how everyth
i
ng, even themselves, seemed unreal; that I did not feel certain that I was even in the room with them; they all looked up and smiled, and again resumed their former positions without saying a word. This was agonizing; were these only the phantoms of my fr
i
ends that I had called up? "Speak to me," I cried; "speak to me, or I will go crazy. I think I see you here; I appear to be in the room with you, yet so uncertain does everything look that I cannot convince myself that it is so. Speak to me, that I may be
 
assured that at least I am not deceived in this." Some one answered me; I heard the voice, it seemed familiar, yet it was the phantom that spoke; all was still unreal; I myself was unreal, even my voice did not seem my own. I tried to reassure myself by c
o
nversing with them. I saw they knew not how I felt. An irresistible desire to make them know how I felt now seized me; this I felt was impossible; they had now no fellow-feeling with me. I was alone; no earthly being could sympathize with me; I saw the im
p
ossibility of making them understand me, yet I must make the attempt; I told them all my feelings; they seemed to think it only imagination, and that I was only using symbols to represent them; my feelings were hurt, and I almost wept; it seemed as if the
y
 doubted my word. I now began to think over my past actions while in this state; it seemed to me a dream; I could not believe I had been upstairs, or even out of the room; no, I had fallen asleep with my guitar in my hand, and had dreamed I was upstairs. 
I
 looked for my guitar; it was not there; certainly then I must have put it away, or else I was dreaming yet; perhaps I had gone to bed at night and been dreaming all along, making a full day's work of dreaming. I became convinced that this was so, but I i
m
mediately thought of the Hashish, which dispelled the illusion; I then asked how long I had been absent from the room; I was answered, "About five minutes;" it had seemed to me as many hours. I asked how I looked; was told, "pale, eyes half-closed and dul
l
, and my hands were cold and clammy." I now felt a resinous matter exude from every pore of my body; it lined my mouth and throat, creating a great thirst. I got a glass of water and drank it; it seemed to form a continuous stream, and ran down my throat 
b
y its own gravity without any aid from me. I became afraid to drink any more; immediately on ceasing to drink it seemed to me that the water had formed itself into one bolus and gone down my throat within an atmosphere of its own, without touching either 
s
ide. So everything appeared different after I had done it from what it did while I was doing. I would sometimes make a remark which I would think of the greatest importance, and speak it in a very impressive manner that it might not be lost; immediately i
t
 would be figured to me as that of another, and I would have to smile at the foolish fellow for making so ridiculous a remark. At one time I felt constrained to let all my thoughts be known. I would think of a thing, digest it in my mind, and then with a 
p
ompous air, would make it known to those about me, something as follows: I was thinking of my thirst and feelings together, and suddenly broke forth with, "This drug is acting very strangely; it is operating upon the fluids of my body; it decomposes my bl
o
od, throwing off the equivalents of water, the oxygen being thrown off at the + poles, the hydrogen at the - poles, and the electricity produced by the decomposition as well as by the reunion of these gases, as they escape through the pores in the form of
 
perspiration, acts upon my nerves and produces this strange feeling; my stomach is the battery, Hashish the acid, and my nerves the conductors." My tongue seemed to be under the control of my will, and things I thought best left unsaid I could generally k
e
ep to myself. My ideas of the propriety of things, however, were at times quite different from what they were in the natural state. After pacing the room (which I did continually to assure myself I still could move), I stopped suddenly, and turning to a s
i
ster, I told her what I thought to be a grand discovery, clothed in the choicest language the English tongue could admit of: "This Hashish," said I, "acts upon the urinary glands, and I feel that could I pass water I would feel better." This was not recei
v
ed as reverently as it should have been, which called forth a lecture on propriety from me, much to the amusement of the rest. I then began a censorship of my own conduct. I began noting my manner of walking and talking, at one time asking if I did not lo
o
k like Mr. C., consequential; at another, like Mr. F., a nervous individual; and again, if I did not act like a Mr. C., a crazy man, remarking that I thought the last-named had taken Hashish. The others now became alarmed at my strange actions, and procur
e
d for me an emetic. I laughed at them, and told them it was no use, I had taken the drug early in the morning. They then brought a mixture of ether; camphor, etc.; I told them it would only make matters worse; I took it, however, at their persuasion. It p
u
t me for awhile in awful agony without taking away my strange feelings, and when its first effects passed off left me extremely melancholy. I gave up hope of coming back to my right state of mind. I asked them to send to the doctor for an antidote, being 
s
atisfied by their answering that they would if I grew worse. I turned my thoughts to what the doctor would say. "What," said I, "if the doctor should say I would never recover; minutes seem years, what an eternity of madness would there be before me then;
 
to know that I must die in my madness at last, how awful !" I could not bear the thought. At the suggestion of the others I went to the parlor, they thinking it would be more cheerful. As it became dark, I became more melancholy. I said that if God did no
t
 will that the antidote should be effective, it would not be effective, but if he willed it to be so, so it would be; suppose we go to God at once, instead of going for the antidote. "There is no use," said I, "of me praying, as I cannot tell whether I am
 
talking or not; besides, God would not hear the prayer of a crazy man; you are in your right senses, one of you pray for me." We knelt down, but the prayer being on the wrong subject, I in disgust turned my thoughts to other matters, and talked of other t
h
ings until supper-time. As I entered the room the light fell full upon me. How beautiful did that light appear; all my melancholy feelings at once left me; I felt a dark shadow lifted from my soul, and all was light within. The light penetrated through my
 
body. I seemed transparent; I could almost look into my own body and see the various organs thereof, all of which seemed to me to be reflecting from their surface a calm lustre, which filled my whole soul. On turning myself to eat, I thought everything ha
d
 something hurtful in it. I could not eat meat, because it had chloride of sodium on it, nor eat bread, because the butter was too strong a stimulant. Being persuaded, however, I ate a piece of meat; to do so I had to call to mind the various processes an
d
 modus operandi of "feeding." "First," I reasoned, "they put the substance in the mouth, and by moving the under jaw down and up and mixing the saliva with it by motion of the tongue, they masticate it." This was easily accomplished. The spittle seemed to
 
have legs and arms, and I could feel it scrambling through the meat, but when it was thoroughly masticated, I could not remember, or rather could not date back to the time I put the meat in my mouth; chewing seemed to have been my regular business for som
e
 time past. It was time now to swallow it; here was a great difficulty. I could move my jaws at will, but to get command of the muscles of my throat wholly baffled all my endeavors. At last I made a sort of compromise. "They throw the bolus back on the to
n
gue, press the tongue on the roof of the mouth, the bolus slides back, irritates the muscles of the pharynx, and down it goes." I tried this, it succeeded admirably, and I applauded myself for my good generalship. A friend called to see me after supper; I
 
determined to keep myself rational while he remained, by force of my will, which I found I could do. At this time the sedative you sent reached me; I took it, and afterwards went to the piano and played until the thrills went off. I had perfect control of
 
my fingers, excepting when I tried to vary a piece I knew well, in which case I could not play anything but the proper notes of the piece, my fingers being drawn to the keys either by force of custom or by tenor of the tune. The full effect of the drug di
d not go off for a week, and even during the next succeeding week I brought back the thrills strongly by taking hot stimulants, though they lasted but a few seconds and brought no hallucinations, }{\fs18\cf2 [2].\{al\}
\par }{A shock, as of some unimagined vital force, shoots without warning through my entire frame, leaping to my fingers ends, piercing my brain, startling me till I almost spring from my chair, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{No pain anywhere, not a twinge in any fibre, yet a cloud of unutterable strangeness was settling upon me, and 
wrapping me impenetrably in from all that was natural or familiar. Endeared faces, well known to me of old, surrounded me, yet they were not with me in my loneliness. I had entered upon a tremendous life which they could not share. If the disembodied ever
 
return to hover over the hearthstone which once had a seat for them, they look upon their friends as I then looked upon mine. A nearness of place with an infinite distance of state, a connection which had no possible sympathies for the wants of that hour 
of revelation, an isolation none the less perfect for seeming companionship, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Yet it was not my voice which spoke; perhaps one which I once had far away in another time and another place. For awhile I knew nothing that was going on externally, and 
then the remembrance of the last remark which had been made returned slowly and indistinctly, as some trait of a dream will return after many days, puzzling us to say where we have been conscious of it before, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{A fitful wind all the evening had be
en sighing down the chimney; it now grew into the steady hum of a vast wheel in accelerating motion. For awhile this hum seemed to resound through all space. I was stunned by it, I was absorbed in it. Slowly the revolution of the wheel came to a stop, and
 
its monotonous din was changed for the reverberating peal of a grand cathedral organ. The ebb and flow of its inconceivably solemn tone filled me with a grief that was more than human. I sympathized with the dirge-like cadence, as spirit sympathizes with 
spirit. And then, in the full conviction that all I heard and felt was real, I looked out of my isolation to see the effect of the music on my friends. Ah! we were in separate worlds indeed. Not a trace of appreciation on any face, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}

\par }{As mechanically
 as an automaton I began to reply. As I heard once more the alien and unreal tones of my own voice, I became convinced that it was some one else who spoke, and in another world. I sat and listened; still the voice kept speaking. Now for the first time, I 
e
xperienced that vast change which Hashish makes in sufficient measurement of time. The first word of the reply occupied a period sufficient for the action of a drama; the last left me in complete ignorance of any point far enough back in the past to date 
t
he commencement of the sentence. Its enunciation might have occupied years. I was not in he same life which had held me when I heard it begun. And now with time, space expanded also. At my friend's house one particular arm-chair was always reserved for me
.
 I was sitting in it at a distance of hardly three feet from the centre-table, around which the members of the family were grouped. Rapidly that distance widened. The whole atmosphere seemed ductile, and spun endlessly out into great spaces surrounding me
 
on every side. We were in a vast hall, of which my friends and I occupied opposite extremities. The ceiling and the walls ran upward with a gliding motion, as if vivified by a sudden force of resistless growth. Oh! I could not bear it. I should soon be le
f
t alone in the midst of an infinity of space. And now every moment increased the conviction that I was watched. I did not know then, as I learned afterwards, that suspicion of all earthly things and persons was the characteristic of the Hashish delirium, 
}{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{In the midst of my complicated hallucination, I could perceive that I had a dual existence. One portion of me was whirled unresistingly along the track of this tremendous experience, the other sat looking down from a height upon its double, observ
ing, reasoning, and serenely weighing all the phenomena. This calmer being suffered with the other by sympathy, but did not lose its self-possession. Presently it warned me that I must go home, lest the growing effect of the Hashish should incite me to so
m
e act which might frighten my friends. I acknowledged the force of this remark very much as if it had been mad by another person, and rose to take my leave. I advanced towards the centre-table. With every step the distance increased. I nerved myself as fo
r a long pedestrian journey, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Still the lights, the faces, the furniture receded. At last, almost unconsciously, I reached them. It would be tedious to attempt to convey the idea of time which my leave-taking consumed, and the attempt, at least, wi
th all minds that have not passed through the same experience would be as impossible as tedious. At last I was in the street. Beyond me the view stretched endlessly away. It was an unconverging vista, whose nearest lamps seemed separated from me by league
s
. I was doomed to pass through a merciless stretch of space. A soul just disenthralled, setting out for his flight beyond the farthest visible star, could not be more overwhelmed with his newly acquired conception of the sublimity of distance than I was a
t that moment. Solemnly I began my infinite journey, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Before long I walked in entire unconsciouness of all around me. I dwelt in a marvellous inner world. I existed by turns in different places and various states of being. Now I swept my gondola th
rough the moonlit lagoons of Venice. Now Alp on Alp towered above my view, and the glory of the coming sun flashed purple light upon the topmost icy pinnacle. Now in the primeval silence of some unexplored tropical forest I spread my feathery leaves a gia
n
t fern, and swayed and nodded in the spice-gales over a river whose waves at once sent up clouds of music and perfume. My soul changed to a vegetable essence, thrilled with a strange and unimagined ecstasy. The palace of Al Haroun could not have brought m
e
 back to humanity. I will not detail all the transmutations of that walk. Ever and anon I returned from my dreams into conciousness, as some well-known house seemed to leap out into my path, awaking me with a shock. The whole way homeward was a series of 
such awakings and relapses into abstraction and delirium until I reached the corner of the street in which I lived, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{My sensations began to be terrific, not from any pain that I felt, but from the tremendous mystery of all around me and within me. 
By an appalling introversion, all the operations of vitality which, in our ordinary state, go on unconsciously, came vividly into my experience. Through every thinnest corporeal tissue and minutest vein I could trace the circulation of the blood along eac
h
 inch of its progress. I knew when every valve opened and when it shut; every sense was preternaturally awakened; the room was full of a great glory. The beating of my heart was so clearly audible that I wondered to find it unnoticed by those who were sit
t
ing by my side. Lo, now, that heart became a great fountain, whose jet played upward with loud vibrations, and, striking upon the roof of my skull as on a gigantic dome, fell back with a splash and echo into its reservoir. Faster and faster came the pulsa
t
ions, until at last I heard them no more, and the stream became one continuously pouring flood, whose roar resounded through all my frame. I gave myself up for lost, since judgment, which still sat unimpaired above my perverted senses, argued that congest
ion must take place in a few moments, and close the drama with my death, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{But my clutch would not yet relax from hope. The thought struck me, might not this rapidity of circulation be, after all, imaginary? I determined to find out. Going to my own
 room, I took out my watch, and placed my hand upon my heart. The very effort which I made to ascertain the reality gradually brought perception back to its natural state. In the intensity of my observations, I began to perceive that the circulation was n
o
t as rapid as I had thought. From a pulseless flow it gradually came to be apprehended as a hurrying succession of intense throbs, then less swift and less intense, till finally, on comparing it with the second-hand, I found that about 90 a minutes was it
s
 average rapidity. Greatly comforted, I desisted from the experiment. Almost instantly the hallucination returned. Again I dreaded apoplexy, congestion, hemorrhage, a multiplicity of nameless deaths, and drew my picture as I might be found on the morrow, 
stark and cold, by those whose agony would be redoubled by the mystery of my end. I reasoned with myself; I bathed my forehead; it did no good. There was one resources left: I would go to a physician, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{With this resolve, I left my room and went to 
the head of the staircase. The family had all retired for the night, and the gas was turned off from the burner in the hall below. I looked down the stairs: the depth was fathomless; it was a journey of years to reach to bottom! The dim light of the sky s
h
one through the narrow panes at the sides of the front door, and seemed a demon-lamp in the middle darkness of the abyss. I never could get down! I sat me down despairingly upon the topmost step. Suddenly a sublime thought possessed me. It shall be tried.
 
I commenced the descent, wearily, wearily down through my league-long, year-long journey. To record my impressions in that journey would be to repeat what I have said of the time of Hashish. Now stopping to rest, as a traveller would turn aside at a waysi
de inn, now toiling down through the lonely darkness, I came by and by to the end, and passed out into the street, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{On reaching the porch of the physician's house I rang the bell, but immediately forgot whom to ask for. No wonder I was on the steps
 of a palace in Milan-no (and I laughed at myself for the blunder), I was on the staircase of the Tower of London. So I should not be puzzled through my ignorance of Italian. But whom to ask for? This question recalled me to the real bearings of the place
,
 but did not suggest its requisite answer. Whom shall I ask for? I began setting the most cunning traps of hypothesis to catch the solution of the difficulty. I looked at the surrounding houses; of whom had I been accustomed to think as living next door t
o
 them? This did not bring it. Whose daughter had been going to school from this house but the very day before? Her name was Julia-julia-and I thought of every combination which had been made with this name from Julia Domna down to Giulia Grisi. Ah! now I 
h
ad it, Julia H.; and her father naturally bore the same name. During this intellectual rummage, I had rung the bell half a dozen times, under the impression that I was kept waiting a small eternity. When the servant opened the door she panted as if she ha
d run for her life, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{My voice seemed to reverberate like thunder from every recess in the whole building I was terrified at the noise I had made. I learned in after days that this impression is only one of the many due to the intense sensibility of
 the sensorium as produced by Hashish. At one time, having asked a friend to check me if I talked loudly or immoderately while in a state of fantasia, among persons from whom I wished to conceal my state, I caught myself singing and shouting from very ecs
tasy, and reproached him with a neglect of his friendly office. I could not believe him when he assured me that I had not uttered and audible word. The intensity of the inward motion had affected the external through the internal ear, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{
al\}
\par }{All was perf
ect silence in the room, and had been perfect darkness also, but for the small lamp which I held in my hand to light the preparation of the powder when it should come. And now a still sublimer mystery began to enwrap me. I stood in a remote chamber at the
 
top of a colossal building, and the whole fabric beneath me was steadily growing into the air. Higher than the topmost pinnacle of Bel's Babylonish temple - higher than Ararat - on, on forever into the lonely dome of God's infinite universe we towered cea
s
elessly. The years flew on; I heard the musical rush of their wings in the abyss outside of me, and from cycle to cycle, from life to life I careered, a mote in eternity and space. Suddenly emerging from the orbit of my transmigrations, I was again at the
 foot of the doctor's bed, and thrilled with wonder that we were both unchanged by the measureless lapse of time, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{The thought struck me that I would compare my time with other people's I looked at my watch, found that its minute-hand stood at the quarter mark past eleven, and, returning it to my pocked, abandoned myself to my reflections, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}

\par }{Presently I saw myself a gnome, imprisoned by a most weird enchanter, whose part I assigned to the doctor before me, in the Domdaniel caverns, "under th
e roots of the ocean." Here, until the dissolution of all things, was I doomed to hold the lamp that lit that abysmal darkness, while my heart, like a giant clock, ticked solemnly the remaining years of time. Now, this hallucination departing, I heard in 
t
he solitude of the night outside the sound of a wondrous heaving sea. Its waves, in sublime cadence, rolled forward till they wet the foundations of the building; they smote them with a might which made the topstone quiver, and then fell back, with hiss a
n
d hollow murmur, into the broad bosom whence they had risen. Now through the street, with measured tread, and armed host passed by. The heavy beat of their footfalls, and the griding of their brazen corslet-rings alone broke the silence, for among them al
l
 there was no more speech nor music than in battalion of the dead. It was the army of the ages going by into eternity. A godlike sublimity swallowed up my soul. I was overwhelmed in a fathomless barathrum of time, but I leaned on God, and was immortal thr
ough all changes, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{And now, in another life, I remembered that far back in the cycles I had looked at my watch to measure the time through which I passed. The impulse seized me to look again. The minute-hand stood half way between fifteen and sixte
en minutes past eleven. The watch must have stopped; I held it to my ear; no, it was still going. I had travelled through all that immeasurable chain of dreams in thirty seconds. "My God!" I cried, "I am in eternity". In the presence of that first sublime
 
revelation of the soul's own time, and her capacity for an infinite life, I stood trembling with breathless awe. Till I die, that moment of unveiling will stand in clear relief from all the rest of my existence. I hold it still in unimpaired remembrance a
s one of the unutterable sanctities of my being. The years of all my earthly life to come can never be as long as those thirty seconds, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{The moment that I closed my eyes a vision of celestial glory burst upon me. I stood on the strand of a transluc
ent, boundless lake, across whose bosom I seemed to have been just transported. A short way up the beach a temple, modelled like the Parthenon, lifted its spotless and gleaming columns of alabaster sublimely into the rosy air, like the Parthenon, yet as m
u
ch excelling it as the godlike ideal of architecture must transcend that ideal realized by man. Unblemished in its purity of whiteness, faultless in the unbroken symmetry of every line and angle, its pediment was draped in odorous clouds, whose tints outs
h
one the rainbow. It was the work of an unearthly builder, and my soul stood before it in a trance of ecstasy. Its folded doors were resplendent with the glory of a multitude of eyes of glass, which were inlaid, throughout the marble surfaces, at the corne
r
s of diamond figures, from the floor of the porch to the topmost moulding. One of these eyes was golden like the midday sun, another emerald, another sapphire, and thus onward through the whole gamut of hues, all of them set in such collocations as to for
m
 most exquisite harmonies, and whirling upon their axes with the rapidity of thought. At the mere vestibule of the temple I could have sat and drunk in ecstasy forever; but lo! I am yet more blessed. On silent hinges the doors swing open, and I pass in. I
 
did not seem to be interior of a temple. I beheld myself as truly in the open air as if I had never passed the portals, for whichever way I looked there were no walls, no roof, no pavement. An atmosphere of fathomless and soul-satisfying serenity surround
e
d and transfused me. I stood upon the bank of a crystal stream, whose waters, as they slid on, discoursed notes of music which tinkled on the ear like the tones of some exquisite bell-glass. The same impression which such tones produce, of music refined t
o
 its ultimate ethereal spirit and borne from a far distance, characterized every ripple of those translucent waves. The gently sloping banks of the stream were luxuriant with a velvety cushioning of grass and moss, so living green that the eye and soul re
p
osed on them at the same time, and drank in peace. Through this amaranthine herbage strayed the gnarled, fantastic roots of giant cedars of Lebanon, from whose primeval trunks great branches spread above me, and interlocking, wove a roof of impenetrable s
h
adow; and wandering down the still avenues, below those grand arboreal arches, went glorious bards, whose snowy beards fell on their breasts beneath countenances of ineffable benignity and nobleness. They were all clad in flowing robes like God's high pri
e
sts, and each one held in his hand a lyre of unearthly workmanship. Presently one stops midway down a shady walk, and, baring his right arm, begins a prelude. While his celestial chords are trembling up into their sublime fulness, another strikes his stri
n
gs, and now they blend upon my ravished ear in such a symphony as was never heard elsewhere, and such as I shall never hear again out of the Great Presence. A moment more, and three are playing in harmony; now the fourth joins the glorious rapture of his 
m
usic to their own, and in the completeness of the chord my soul is swallowed up. I can bear no more. But yes, I am sustained, for suddenly the whole throng I break forth in a chorus, upon whose wings I am lifted out of the riven walls of sense, and music 
a
nd spirit thrill in immediate communion. Forever rid of the intervention of pulsing air and vibrating nerve, my soul dilates with the swell of that transcendent harmony, and interprets from it arcana of a meaning which words can never tell. I am born alof
t
 upon the glory of sound. I float in a trance among the burning choir of the seraphim. But, as I am melting through the purification of that sublime ecstasy into oneness with the Deity himself, one by one those pealing lyres faint away, and as the last th
rob dies down along the measureless ether, visionless arms swiftly as lightning carry me far into the profound, and set me down before another portal. Its leaves, like the first, are of spotless marble, but ungemmed with wheeling eyes of burning color, }{
\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{I will make a digression, for the purpose of introducing two laws of the Hashish operation, which, as explicatory, deserve a place here. First: after the completion of any one fantasia has arrived, there almost invariably succeeds a shifting of the a
ction to some other stage entirely different in its surroundings. In this transition the general character of the emotion may remain unchanged. I may be happy in Paradise, and happy at the sources of the Nile, but seldom, either in Paradise or on the Nile
,
 twice in succession, I may writhe in Etna and burn unquenchably in Gehenna, but almost never, in the course of the same delirium, shall Etna of Gehenna witness my torture a second time. Second: after the full storm of a vision of intense sublimity has bl
o
wn past a Hashish eater, his next vision is generally of a quiet, relaxing, and recreating nature. He comes down from his clouds or up from his abyss into a middle ground of gentle shadows, where he may rest his eyes from the splendor of the seraphim or t
he flames of fiends. There is a wise philosophy in this arrangement, for otherwise the soul would soon burn out in the excess of its own oxygen. Many a time it seems to me has my own thus been saved from extinction, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Although the last experience of
 which I had been conscious had seemed to satisfy every human want, physical or spiritual, I smiled on the four plain white walls of my bedchamber, and hailed their familiar unostentatiousness with a pleasure which had no wish to transfer itself to arabes
q
ue or rainbows. It was like returning home from an eternity spent in loneliness among the palaces of strangers. Well may I say and eternity, for during the whole day I could not rid myself of the feeling that I was separated from the preceding one by an i
mmeasurable lapse of time. In fact, I never got wholly rid of it, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Every function had returned to its normal state, with the one exception mentioned; memory could not efface the traces of my having passed through a great mystery, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{The phen
omenon of the dual existence once more presented itself. One part of me awoke, while the other continued in perfect hallucination. The awakened portion felt the necessity of keeping in side streets on the way home, lest some untimely burst of ecstasy shou
ld startle more frequented thoroughfares, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{And now that unutterable thirst which characterizes Hashish came upon me. I could have lain me down and lapped dew from the grass. I must drink, wheresoever, howsowhere. We soon reached home; soon, because
 it was not five squares off where we sat down, yet ages, from the thirst which consumed me, and the expansion of time in which I lived. I came into the house as one would approach a fountain in a desert, with a wild bound of exultation, and gazed with mi
s
erly eyes at the draught which my friend poured out for me until the glass was brimming. I clutched it; I put it to my lips. Ha! a surprise. It was not water, but the most delicious metheglin in which ever bard of the Cymri drank the health of Howell Dda.
 It danced and sparkled like some liquid metempsychosis of amber; it gleamed with the spiritual fire of a thousand chrysolites. To sight, to taste it was metheglin, such as never mantled in the cups of Valhalla, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{After the walk which I last recorde
d, the former passion for travel returned with powerful intensity. I had now a way of gratifying it, which comported both with indolence and economy. The whole East, from Greece to farthest China, lay within the compass of a township. No outlay was necess
a
ry for the journey. For the humble sum of six cents I might purchase an excursion ticket over all the earth; ships and dromedaries, tents and hospices, were all contained in a box of Tilden's extract. Hashish I called the "drug of travel", and I had only 
t
o direct my thoughts strongly towards a particular part of the world previously to swallowing my bolus, to make my whole fantasia in the strongest possible degree topographical. Or, when the delirium was at its height, let any one suggest to me, however f
a
intly, mountain, wilderness, or market-place, and straightway I was in it, drinking in the novelty of my surroundings in all the ecstasy of a discoverer. I swam up against the current of all time; I walked through Luxor and Palmyra as they were of old; on
 Babylon the bittern had not built her nest, and I gazed on the unbroken columns of the Parthenon, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{There are two facts which I have verified as universal by repeated experiment, which fall into their place here as aptly as they can in the course o
f my narrative. 1st. At two different times, when body and mind are apparently in precisely analogous states, when all circumstances, exterior and interior, do not differ tangibly in the smallest respect, the same dose of the same preparation of Hashish w
i
ll frequently produce diametrically opposite effects. Still further, I have taken at one time a pill of thirty grains, which hardly gave a perceptible phenomenon, and at another, when my dose had been but half that quantity, I have suffered the agonies of
 
a martyr, or rejoiced in a perfect frenzy. So exceedingly variable are its results that, long before I abandoned the indulgence, I took each successive bolus with the consciousness that I was daring an uncertainty as tremendous as the equipoise between he
l
l and heaven. Yet the fascination employed Hope as its advocate, and won the suit. 2d. If, during the ecstasy of Hashish delirium, another dose, however small, yes, though it be no larger than half a pea, be employed to prolong the condition, such agony w
i
ll inevitably ensue as will make the soul shudder at its own possibility of endurance without annihilation. By repeated experiments, which now occupy the most horrible place upon my catalogue of horrible remembrances have I proved that, among all the vari
able phenomena of Hashish, this alone stands unvarying. The use of it directly after any other stimulus will produce consequences as appalling, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{The effects of the Hashish increased, as it always does, with the excitement of the visions and the exe
rcise of walking. I began to be lifted into that tremendous pride which is so often a characteristic of the fantasia. My powers became superhuman; my knowledge covered the universe; my scope of sight was infinite, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{
What mattered it that my far-off battlements were the walls of a college, my mighty plain a field, and my wind of balm but an ordinary sunset breeze? To me all joys were real; yes, even with a reality which utterly surpasses the hardest facts of the ordin
ary world, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Upon William N., Hashish produced none of the effects characteristic of fantasia. There was no hallucination, no volitancy of unusual images before the eye when closed. Circulation, however, grew to a surprising fulness and rapidity, ac
companied by the same introversion of faculties and clear perception of all physical processes which startled me in my first experiment upon myself. There was stertorous breathing, dilatation of the pupil, and a drooping appearance of the eyelid, followed
 
at last by a comatose state, lasting for hours, out of which it was almost impossible fully to arouse the energies. These symptoms, together with a peculiar rigidity of the muscular system, and inability to measure the precise compass and volume of the vo
ice when speaking, brought the case nearer in resemblance to those recorded by Dr. O'Slaughnessy, of Calcutta, as occurring under his immediate inspection among the natives of India than any I have witnessed, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Repeatedly have I wandered past doors 
and houses which, in my ordinary condition, were as well known as my own, and have at last given up the search for them in utter hopelessness, recognizing not the faintest familiar trace in their aspect. Certainly a Hashish-eater should never be alone, }{
\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{In William N., I observed, however, one phenomenon which characterizes Hashish-existence in persons of far different constitutions, the expansion of time and space. Walking with him a distance not exceeding a furlong, I have seen him grow weary and 
assume a look of hopelessness, which he explained by telling me that he could never traverse the immensity before him. Frequently, also, do I remember his asking to know the time thrice in as many minutes, and when answered, he exclaimed, "Its it possible
? I supposed it was an hour since I last inquired." His temperament was a mixture of the phlegmatic and nervous, and he was generally rather unsusceptible to stimulus, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Suddenly Bob leaped up from the lounge on which he had been lying, and, with lo
ud peals of laughter, danced wildly over the room. A strange light was in his eyes, and he gesticulated furiously, like a player in a pantomime. Suddenly he stopped dancing, and trembling, as with an indefinable fear, he whispered, "What will become of me
?" }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{Having taken Hashish and felt its influence already for several hours, he still retained enough of conscious self-control to visit the room of a 
certain excellent pianist without exciting the suspicion of the latter. Fred, threw himself upon a sofa immediately on entering, and asked the artist to play him some piece of music, without naming any one in particular. The prelude began. With its first 
h
armonious rise and fall the dreamer was lifted into the choir of a grand cathedral. Thenceforward it was heard no longer as exterior; but I shall proceed to tell how it was embodied in one of the most wonderful imaginative representations that it has ever
 
been my lot to know. The windows of nave and transept were emblazoned, in the most gorgeous coloring, with incidents culled from saintly lives. Far off in the chancel monks were loading the air with essences that streamed from their golden censers; on the
 
pavement of inimitable mosaic knelt a host of reverent worshippers in silent prayer. Suddenly, behind him, the great organ began a plaintive minor, like the murmur of some bard relieving his heart in threnody. This minor was joined by a gentle treble voic
e
 among the choir in which he stood. The low wail rose and fell as with the expression of wholly human emotion. One by one the remaining singers joined in, and now he heard, thrilling to the very roof of the cathedral, a wondrous miserere. But the pathetic
 
delight of hearing was soon supplanted by, or rather mingled with, a new sight in the body of the pile below him. At the farther end of the nave a great door slowly swung open, and a bier entered supported by solemn bearers. Upon it lay a coffin covered b
y
 a heavy pall, which, being removed as the bier was set down in the chancel, discovered the face of the sleeper. It was the dead Mendelssohn! The last cadence of the death-chant died away; the bearers, with heavy tread, carried the coffin through an iron 
d
oor to its place in the vault; one by one the crowd passed out of the cathedral, and at last, in the choir, the dreamer stood alone. He turned himself also to depart, and, awakened to complete consciousness, beheld the pianist just resting from the keys. 
"
What piece have you been playing?" asked Fred. The musician replied it was "Mendelssohn's Funeral March." This piece, Fred, solemnly assured me, he had never heard before. The phenomenon thus appears inexplicable by any hypothesis which would regard it as
 
a mere coincidence. Whether this vision was suggested by and unconscious recognition of Mendelssohn's style in the piece performed, or by the awaking of some unknown intuitional faculty, it was produced as an original creation, I know not, but certainly i
t is as remarkable an instance of sympathetic clairvoyance as I ever knew, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{In the broad daylight of a summer afternoon, I was walking in the full possession of delirium. For an hour the expansion of all visible things had been growing towards its 
height; it now reached it, and to the fullest extent I apprehended what is meant by the infinity of space. Vistas no longer converged; sight met no barrier; the world was horizonless, for earth and sky stretched endlessly onward in paralleled planes. Abov
e
 me the heavens were terrible with the glory of a fathomless depth. I look up, but my eyes, unopposed, every moment penetrated farther and farther into the immensity, and I turned them downward, lest they should presently intrude into the fatal splendors 
o
f the Great Presence. Unable to bear visible objects, I shut my eyes. In one moment, a colossal music filled the whole hemisphere above me, and I thrilled upward through its environment on visionless wings. It was not song, it was not instruments, but the
 
inexpressible spirit of sublime sound-like nothing I ever heard-impossible to be symbolized; intense, yet not loud; the ideal of harmony, yet distinguishable into a multiplicity of exquisite parts. I opened my eyes, but it still continued. I sought around
 
me to detect some natural sound which might be exaggerated into such a semblance; but no, it was of unearthly generation, and it thrilled through the universe and inexplicable a beautiful, yet an awful symphony. Suddenly my mind grew solemn with the consc
i
ousness of a quickened perception. And what a solemnity is that which the Hashish-eater feels at such a movement! The very beating of his heart is silenced; he stands with his finger on his lip; his eyes are fixed, and he becomes a very statue of awful ve
n
eration. The face of such a man, however little glorified in feature or expression during his ordinary states of mind, I have stood and looked upon with the consciousness that I was beholding more of the embodiment of the truly sublime, than any created b
e
ing could ever offer me. I looked abroad on fields, and waters, and sky, read in them a most startling meaning. I wondered how I had ever regarded them in the light of dead matter, at the farthest only suggesting lessons. They were now, as in my former vi
s
ion, grand symbols of the sublimest spiritual truths-truths never before even feebly grasped, and utterly unsuspected. Like a map the arcana of the universe lay bare before me. I saw how every created thing not only typifies, but springs forth from some m
ighty spiritual law as its offspring, its necessary external development, not the mere clothing of the essence, but the essence incarnate, }{\fs18\cf2 [17].\{al\}
\par }{As I have frequently said, I felt no depression of body. The flames of my vision had not withered a single c
orporeal tissue nor snapped a single corporeal cord. All the pains induced by the total abandonment of Hashish were spiritual. From the ethereal heights of Olympus I had been dropped into the midst of an Acherontian fog. My soul breathed laboriously, and 
g
rew torpid with every hour. I dreaded an advancing night of oblivion. I sat awaiting extinction. The shapes which moved about me in the outer world seemed liked galvanized corpses; the living soul of nature, with which I had so long communed, had gone out
 
like the flame of a candle, and her remaining exterior was as poor and meaningless as those wooden trees with which children play, and the cliffs and chalets carved out of boxwood by some Swiss in his winter leisure. Moreover, actual pain had not ceased w
i
th abandonment of the indulgence. In some fiery dreams of night, or some sudden thrill of daylight, the old pangs were reproduced with a vividness only less than amounting to hallucination. I opened my eyes, I rubbed my forehead, I arose and walked; they

a
 cruel sham of some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a speechless beauty. I hated flowers, for I had seen the enamelled meads of Paradise; I cursed the rocks, because they were mute stone; the sky, because it rang with no music; and ear

 footstep on the stairs was sufficient to make me tremble with anticipations of a conversation; every morning brought a resurrection into renewed horrors, as I thought of the advancing necessity of once more coming in contact with men and things, }{

\par I 
soon became conscious of a sense of disappointment. I said, "That was not Hasheesh, but some preparation of chocolate." I took my pen to write an indignant letter to my friend who had procured it, that he might know that I had not become an easy dupe to h
i
s plan for deceiving me. I was at a loss how to begin the letter, though otherwise always ready at writing, even when fatigued, as I then was, from sitting up two successive nights reading Jacob Behmen. For a moment I paused, considering, and then the par
i
etal bones expanded widely, as if parting at the sutures, and again collapsed with a sort of shuffling sound. I said, "This is the result of fatigue; I have read too hard, I will go to bed." As I rose from my table I became conscious of an agreeable state
 
of warmth and lightness, I felt as if I had taken Scotch whiskey. The room seemed larger than usual, and getting larger and larger still; some skulls of animals on the walls acquired colossal proportions, and the conviction entered my mind that I had real
i
zed an old dream of living in the midst of the monsters of the colitic period, and that I had been awestruck for years, immovable, paralyzed, and with every faculty benumbed except that of wonder! I caught sight of my watch hanging in front of some papers
 
on the wall, and it at once dispelled the illusion. I calmly looked at it, and found it was just twenty minutes since I took the Hasheesh. Immediately the watch expanded to vast dimensions, and its ticking sounded through my head like the pulsation of a w
o
rld. I knew now for the first time that I was under the influence of the drug, and began to make a few notes in pencil. Suddenly my limbs seemed benumbed, my toes shrunk within my slippers, my fingers became like the long legs of a convulsed spider; I dro
p
ped the pencil and walked to the window. The landscape was so sublime that I forgot the cause of the illusion in my admiration of the magical scene. The horizon was removed to an infinite distance, but was still discernible, and the sunset had marked it o
u
t with myriads of fiery circles, all revolving, mingling together, expanding, and then changing to an aurora, which shot up to the zenith and fell down in sparks and splashes among the trees, which at once became illuminated, and the whole scene was grand
 
beyond description, with fires of every conceivable color. All this time the landscape continued to expand; everything grew, as I looked on, to greater and greater proportions. Trees shot up higher and higher, their branches overspread the sky; they met t
o
gether and became a confused mass; the lights, which just before had glowed on every hand, changed to a general purple haze. A sense of twitching in every limb, coupled with a feeling of weariness and depression, caused me to turn aside and sit down. The 
t
witching changed to a sharp pricking sensation, most violent in the extremities, and for the moment the thought occurred to me that I had been poisoned by Strychnine. I opened a drawer to find an emetic, but the drawer had gone, and in its place sat one o
f
 my antediluvian monsters grinning at me, a real ichthyosaurus, with a red cap on its head, and with drum and pandean pipes. For about six weeks, so at the time I determined the period, it played a monotonous tune, while I sat on the ground laughing and e
n
joying the idea of my fingers and toes being elongated into claws, when suddenly the thought seized me that I would destroy the illusion by an effort. I dashed at the monster, and my head fell on the handle of the drawer. The dream was dissolved; I could 
c
learly understand the ticking of my watch, and the singing of a bird in the garden, were the real sounds which my fancy had changed to drums and pipes of my oolitic companion. I once more looked at my watch, and though years seemed to have elapsed since t
h
e spell began, I found the real period to be but twenty-five minutes. This last act of observing the time again threw me off my balance, I said, "Twenty-five minutes, twenty-five days, twenty-five months, twenty-five years, twenty-five centuries, twenty-f
ive \'e6
ons; now I know it all, I am the alchemist who discovered the elixir of life in the dark ages, and I shall live forever. What is time to me? Yes, that was the elixir I took twenty-five minutes ago to experience a sensation, and there it goes round the 
room." It made me giddy to see it whirl like a wheel, of which I was the centre. There was a bust of Milton on the shelf, which had changed to the face of Jacob Behmen, and it sat on one of the spokes of the wheels, and smiled upon me with such a smile of
 
peace and satisfaction that I shouted "Ha, ha!" The wheel revolved; it became brilliant with fiery coruscations; and by degrees the centre where I sat became the circumference, and I was whirled with it, my head opening and shutting, so that I could feel 
t
he cold air on my brain; my breath getting short and difficult, my chest falling, as if crushed by a weight, and my stomach gnawed by rats. This went on for ages; yet I knew all the while where I was, and how the whole thing had happened, and actually got
 
up, rang the bell and ordered some coffee, though not for an instant did the illusion cease, nor, so far I ever learnt, did the servant who answered me discover any signs of my aberration. I thought of the coffee as likely to relieve the sense of oppressi
o
n and disorder, which was now fast dispelling the illusion by its reality. I felt my pulse and tried to count it. I knew afterwards that it was full and rapid; but at the time the throbs were like the heaving of mountains, and the numbers would multiply t
h
emselves, so that as I counted "one, two, three," they became "one, two, three years, centuries, ages," and I literally shrieked with the overpowering thought that I had lived from all eternity, and should live to all eternity, in a palace of colored stal
a
ctites, supported by shafts of emerald resting on a sea of liquid gold, for this was now the appearance of things, and the gnawing at my stomach suggested the idea that I should be starved to death, and yet live the deformed wreck of a deluded man. At thi
s
 moment there was a tap at the door, and the servant entered with the coffee. It was in a huge tankard, chased all over with dragons, that extended all round the world, and I saw the odor of it play round her in circles of light, and for at least an hour 
s
he stood smiling and hesitating where to place it, because my table was covered with papers. I very removed a few of the papers, and heaved a sigh that dissipated the dragons, made the odors fall in a shower of rain, and she put down the tray with a crash
 
that made every bone in my body vibrate, as if struck by ten thousand hammers. I know not whether she was alarmed at my appearance, but she stood apparently aghast, and her rosy face expanded to the size of a balloon, and away she went with the rapidity o
f
 lightning, with Mr. Green in the car, and I stood applauding in the midst of thousands of lamps, which I had time to note, as the scene continued during a period which seemed indefinite, were all glow-worms, which I could touch, and they communicated to 
m
y fingers phosphorescent sparks, as if they had been rubbed with Lucifer matches. [Only a few days before I had some glow-worms in the garden, and on handling them, found my fingers tipped with a dull phosphoric glow. This probably gave rise to the illusi
o
n. In fact, I afterwards traced many of my sensations during the paroxysm to previous events, and almost believe the illusions are the result of abnormal memory.] But I knew this was unreal, and I drank the coffee with the most perfect composure, though I
 
felt it difficult to pour it out without spilling it, and the cup came to my lips as if it were the rim of a caldron, seething with a stew of spices and nepenthe; and amid the steam I could see the fierceness and tartness and prima materia of Jacob Behmen
,
 all displayed, so that there was an end of the mystery, and I could see into his brain, as he now seemed to be looking into mine. The moment I sipped the coffee it darted through me, and caused sensation of insupportable heat. The gnawing sensation of st
o
mach and contraction of chest gave way to a sense of pricking, most violent in fingers and toes, and yet, though painful, this was all pleasant; and though I could now collectively observe the objects around me, yet they would transport themselves to imme
a
surable distances, and keep continually dilating in size; and though I looked at my watch, and saw that only forty minutes had elapsed, yet there was a secret persuasion in my mind that a period of at least forty centuries had gone by since I broke off a 
f
ragment of Hasheesh, and committed myself to this dream. There seemed to be now only one effect of the drug remaining, and that was a sense of warmth all over the body, and a tendency in my head to expand and fill the room. But my arms dropped down; I cou
l
d not keep them up without great and painful effort. I finished the coffee, experienced less of the pricking sensation than at first, and then rose and went to bed. I could walk without difficulty, though my legs were immensely long, and felt as if they w
o
uld presently be cramped, so that I should cry out. As I undressed myself, my clothes would fly from me far away into boundless space, and become wandering stars; the buttons of my vest glittered in the firmament like Orion, but much more vast and splendi
d
. I did not dare to look out of the window. I endeavored to control myself, for I began to feel a sense of dread. As I got into bed the bed extended. As I lay down at full length, I myself extended; and as soon as I shut my eyes I felt that I covered the 
s
pace of the whole earth. I had a sense of indescribable pain all over me. My skin seemed to move to and fro upon my flesh; my head swelled to awful dimensions, and I parted in two from head to foot; became two persons, each throbbing, breathing hard, sigh
i
ng loudly, and lost in a commixture of ethereal, yet agonizing, colors and sounds. These seemed to continue for ages; but I was really asleep, and I never could call to mind at what time I went to bed, or at what point the illusion sleep came upon me, but
 
I always supposed it to be when I felt myself parted in twain, and immersed in light and music. The next day I woke early, and seemingly unrefreshed. I lay some hours pondering upon the strange effects the drug had produced, and found it difficult for som
e
 time to prevent the intrusion of some broken fragments of the visions from taking possession of me; but when I had dressed and breakfasted I felt as well as usual. In a second experiment, when unaffected by fatigue, I noticed that every physical and ment
a
l power seemed intensified. The illusions were more agreeable and more ridiculous. I was the subject of a thousand different moods in the course of a few seconds, which, as in the former case, seemed ages; and these moods were nearly always swallowed up i
n
 some strange vision of walls receding, landscapes rolling away to a horizon they never reached, skies opening to views of boundless space, and sudden flashes before the eyes of visible odors, sounds, and ideas. The most remarkable feature of this paroxys
m
 was a feeling that my soul was too large for my body, and must expand it to suitable dimensions. This pained me. I gasped for my breath, and felt my skin stretch and crack, and my joints fly like the snapping of huge beams of timber. These illusions beca
m
e instantly the foundation ot others. The cracking of my skin became suddenly a display of fireworks, and the snapping of my joints the beating of gongs. Still pleasurable sensations prevailed; old memories were revived as pictures; and in many respects t
he effects resembled those of }{\i\cf2 Opium}{
. But with Opium there is a more entire and settled acquiescence of the illusions, and the ideas are more continuous and connected. With Hasheesh there is a rapid succession of new scenes and startling combinations. Where 
there is no pain, the mind is literally whirled away in a succession of ravishing delights, and is yet all the while conscious that the whole affair is a deception. This paroxysm was soon over. It ended in a joyous feeling, in which life seemed lengthened
 
out beyond the natural term, and all around me were objects of transcendent beauty, which I had the power of resolving into realities by an effort of the will; and it seemed that by successively using this effort the spell was broken, and the effect of th
e
 drug entirely destroyed. The third dose (of 4 scruples) was the last. I took it at midday, when in usual health and spirits. I at once went out and proceeded across Finsbury Square, in the direction of the city. It seemed that about a quarter of an hour 
h
ad elapsed, during which I had a comfortable sense of warmth and an increasing tendency to open my mouth for air, though I was not aware of any difficulty of breathing. "Now," said I, "this is pleasant; I shall have a glorious time of it." Immediately a v
o
ice shouted, "There he goes, he always inflated." I was at once conscious that I was observed by passers-by to be expanding rapidly, and I felt myself rise from the ground and walk above it. I halted, and by an effort of the mind, collected myself, and fo
u
nd that the voice was that of a man selling some wares in Moorgate Street, who had not even noticed me, nor had any one else. But the thought occurred immediately, "This is a delusion; I am expanding, and cannot touch the ground." For a moment, it might b
e
, but it seemed an indefinite period, I saw the whole city spread out before me as a diorama. The church bells rang joyously; the houses were illuminated; the horses had gold and silver trappings; the people were waltzing, singing, laughing, and playing w
i
th fireworks. I again exerted my will, and felt a disgust at the meanness of such a performance, so far short did it come of my own sense of sublimity; for I felt exalted, and had the utmost consciousness that I was able to separate the false from the tru
e
, though I really could not. I retraced my steps, and was accompanied home by triumphal bands of music, shouts of triumph, running footmen carrying colored flambeaux; and I gradually quickened my pace till I ran too, only touching the ground at intervals,
 
but for the most part swimming through the air; yet knowing that I walked as other people, and knowing too that the ordinary sounds and scenes of streets were the foundation of the delusion. I reached my home and went to my study, with a sense of satisfac
t
ion that I was now in a safer position than in the streets under such an influence. I sat down and began to fill a pipe with Turkey tobacco. The pipe would lengthen out so that I could not reach the bowl, yet I did reach it; and, in like manner, the tobac
c
o-jar seemed deep enough to serve for one of those used in "Ali Baba, or the Forty Thieves;" and it suddenly became a row of jars, and out of them leaped the forty thieves, with monkeys' faces and red jackets on. [I had seen a monkey on a barrel-organ dur
i
ng my walk, and tested my sanity by noting all its zoological features, in order to determine its species, but I lost it suddenly.] I lighted my pipe, and as the cloud rose, I saw all the party had lighted their pipes, and were all proper Arabs, and I was
 
in the midst about to tell them a tale. By some strange freak they all suddenly collapsed, and became the double of myself, and yet they continued smoking. I now saw in the stomach of my double a huge cake of Hasheesh, which presently shot up into his bra
i
n, and I felt a hot throbbing of the head, and the thought occurred, "Why, if he has the Hasheesh, have I the burning, and how can that shadow smoke so calmly with a mass of poison in his brain?" I rose and propounded my double a problem, "How in the end,
 
matter and spirit would be completely identified and made as one?" I was assured, in reply, that a sense of lightness would accomplish all, and I became as light as a feather; I swayed to and fro, I was lifted up, sparks flashed in my eyes, fire was emitt
e
d from my fingers, head, and stomach, and presently there was an awful crash, and I came to myself with the though that I was going mad. I saw the pipe in fragments at my feet, and the burning tobacco on the hearth-rug. I coolly picked it up with my hand,
 
took another pipe, dropped the smoking tobacco into it, and saw my double again. This time he was the body and I was the shadow. I felt myself to be nothing. I was the soul, and beside me was the body. I thought I had now solved the problem of matter and 
s
pirit; I said, "They are only two forms of the same fact;" and I laughed aloud, and they all laughed with me, the umbrellas I mean, for my umbrella hung on a hat-rail, and it peopled the room with offspring; and away went the furniture and ornaments and b
o
oks, all carrying umbrellas, dancing, whistling, and splashing water from the pools upon me, till I stamped my foot and smothered myself with sparks and planets and auroras, and sank back with a pain in the head that literally dispelled the delusions, and
 
created a momentary alarm. I was now beset with prickings; I seemed to swell; I had a difficulty in breathing, and yet it was a pleasant one. I put the tobacco away, inspected everything about me, and thought of trying the effects of reading aloud and att
e
mpting to sing; but I found my strength gone, I was spellbound, so light I could not govern my movements, and by degrees I began to discover that the illusion was over, that it had left me tremulous, and with a low pulse, and requiring refreshment for my 
r
ecovery. The first act, on fairly reviewing the case, was to seize the fragment of Hasheesh which remained and fling it up the chimney. It went up, and did not even return again. I saw it go into the sky, and become a bird, for the chimney was glass, and 
I
 could see through all its windings. I now felt that madness had really come upon me, and I began to bathe my temples and drink soda-water, and soon discovered that I had had a second paroxysm, for there lay the Hasheesh among the shavings in the fireplac
e
. I applied a match; there was a glorious blaze; and I now saw it dissolve into a grand procession of colored lights, that died away and left me quietly and collectedly reflecting on the whole affair. This was the third paroxysm. There was yet one more, b
ut of a trivial nature, and I had now done with Hasheesh, }{\fs18\cf2 [60].\{al\}
\par }{About half an hour after taking the medicine I was at the dinner-table, and we were all laughing and jesting, and enjoying our dinner meal with more levity than usual, I taking the lead in 
the merriment. I was just about finishing dinner, when suddenly I felt a thrill pass through me; the room and the dining-table seemed to rise up and swing, or float about. There was a sensation of lightness and dreaminess connected with everything. I had 
b
een conversing, but in the beginning of these sensations had leaned upon my elbow on the table, which attracted the attention of my wife, who asked what pained me. I answered that there was no pain, but that I experienced a peculiar kind of sensation whic
h
 I hoped would soon pass away. Summoning up my will, I arose and walked into the parlor, and took a seat, and tried to compose myself; but the sensations continued to come on. For as few seconds after the first thrill, I thought all was going to pass off,
 
but now the symptoms were increasing in intensity I arose and went to the glass to look at myself, and to notice the appearance of the pupils of my eyes. Up to this time I would not relieve I was under the influence of Cannabis. My condition rapidly grew 
w
orse, worse, I say, for my sensations were of the most disagreeable and horrible nature possible. I felt as if reason was being hurled by violence from its throne. Sensations and states of consciousness, rather than ideas, were wildly passing through my m
i
nd. I said to my wife, "I am in a terrible situation, something must be done." I called for an emetic. While it was being prepared, I was all the time becoming more and more restless and agitated. I arose and walked out into the hall, and thought to mysel
f
 what is the use of me running around like a wild man, and returned and sat down in my chair, but could not be easy. The emetic was brought and I swallowed it. I then said, "Give me some warm water," and started for the kitchen. Some one proposed a hot fo
o
t-bath of mustard-water; I said, "Yes, let it be got immediately." A few minutes more and I was in the kitchen, before the stove, with my feet in a boiler of hot water. By this time my condition was awful in the extreme. My own voice sounded strangely to 
m
e when I spoke, while the voices of those about me sounded as if obscured by a gauze or veil over my senses; the sounds seemed far off, dreamy, and unreal. I was beginning to have a sort of double or even triple consciousness. It seemed as if I were livin
g
 three lives at once. Anything spoken to me, immediately seemed to have an age ago. The few movements I made were governed by the will, and yet they seemed automatic, as I could not feel myself move. Indeed, I seemed to have lost my body and become all dr
e
amy imagination. I moved occasionally, but had no physical sense of doing so. After swallowing a quantity of warm water, I unbuttoned my vest, but did not even seem to touch the buttons, and yet I must have had some sense of feeling, for I did not watch t
h
e movements of my hands. I saw with my eyes, but nothing was natural. I looked at the wall and objects around; an impression was made upon the sensorium and the visual impression seemed hurried off at lightning speed, then immediately the same impression 
w
as made with some different phase, while an age almost seemed to intervene between these changing states of consciousness. A moment seemed an eternity; the most terrible depression came on. My mental states and sensations seemed to move in circles. Rapidl
y
, smoothly, and noiselessly, I seemed to be carried down a psychical maelstrom. The voices about me sounded in my ears as a dull dreamy droning, although I understood all that was said. Dissolution seemed imminent. Rapidly I was sinking down the horrid ma
e
lstrom of my own imagination, each revolution bringing me nearer to the pointed bottom below, which I thought would be death. I still could get out, by great effort of the will, as it seemed to me, short sentences; but when I spoke only three words, befor
e
 the third was uttered the first seemed to be far in the distant past. When I spoke, I seemed as if started from a dream; a flash of light came before my eyes, and everything seemed to rise up suddenly before me. I remember that the floor seemed to be slo
p
ing up before me, and pitching off behind. I now labored fully under a triple consciousness, two dreamy and unreal, and underlying these, apparently, was my real self, obscured by the intoxication upon me. I seemed to pass successively from one state of c
o
nsciousness to another. When in one state, I remembered the successive changes of sensation in that state that had occurred previously. Noise or movement seemed to transfer me immediately to another state of consciousness. In this new state, the recollect
i
on of the sensations in the other state were dim and soon forgotten, while I seemed to remember back in the line of consciousness in which I there was. Through all these wonderful psychical phenomena, I preserved a good degree of rationality. I remember d
i
stinctly to have reflected, "What is my condition?" "How long is it going to last?" I told the attendants Ipecac, would not vomit me, to get mustard and water. When they were going to give me lemonade, I tasted it, and said, "It is not sour enough, put in
 
Citric acid, it is the acid that is antidote to the Hasheesh." During all the time I was sitting stupidly in a chair, before the stove, making but few movements. I lost all correct idea of time; a moment seemed an age. I thought they would never get the m
u
stard for me. After drinking the mustard mixture I called for warm water, and thought they would never get it ready, and called for it, as I thought, about once every fifteen minutes, supposing they had forgotten to bring it. My wife says I spoke incessan
t
ly, repeating my request as fast as I could. As recollect now, it seems to me I called only three or four times for anything, and then at long intervals. I still seemed to be sinking down into the maelstrom, and was nearing the apex below, when suddenly I
 
gave a retch, and began to vomit. While in the very act of straining to vomit I felt more natural, because, I suppose of the change of circulation within the cerebrum. The vomiting over, I felt I was about gone, and said, as it seemed to me, with an awful
 
effort, "Put me in bed, I shall know nothing in a few minutes more." At one time I really thought I was entering the world beyond, and was wondering how things would appear, when something changed the current of my ideas. Just as I started to bed, I had r
e
ached the climax of wretchedness. A few minutes before I had taken some lemon-juice, which they brought me instead of the Citric acid solution I had called for, and now the symptoms seemed to begin to abate. The revolving panorama of sensations seemed to 
m
ove more slowly, and each revolution appeared to bring me back, up, more to the light, and to myself again. I was now in bed, had walked from the kitchen, but did not feel the floor; with a feeling of relief, I said, "I shall get all right again." My hand
s
 now began to become cold, and then my feet, and I requested to be kept warm, and asked to have my hands rubbed. From this on I dozed in a dreamy, intoxicated manner; for a few seconds I lost myself in sleep, and then started up, seeming to have just comp
l
eted another round, ascending the same spiral maelstrom which I had previously descended; still I had no correct idea of time; my hands were still cold, and I asked the attendants to chafe them, and then dropped into a doze, and after, as it seemed to me,
 
half or three-quarters of an hour, I aroused and repeated the request. Those who were attending me say I was incessantly repeating the request. They put warm bricks to my feet, and I immediately dozed off again, and in less than half a minute asked them t
o
 put something warm to my foot, saying I was nearly frozen. I was reminded that it had already been done a moment before. I remembered the circumstance, but it seemed to have been at least two or three hours before. From this on the symptoms of intoxicati
o
n gradually abated. After dark, at 7 o'clock, I could converse very readily, but time dragged very slowly. Toward morning I slept somewhat more naturally, but was nervous, and felt achings in my back and neck, and soreness of my sides, from vomiting. Next
 
morning my appetite was poor, my head ached, and I felt dull all day, much the same, I imagine, as a man after a drunken spree. During the whole operation of the medecine the pupils of my eyes were natural, and after the first few minutes the color of my 
f
ace was the same as usual. My pulse was at first rapid and strong, afterwards not so strong, but faster than common; my hands and feet were cool, from the end of the first to the middle of the third hour. At no time was there any disposition to spasmodic 
movements of any kind; the disposition was rather to lie inactive and quiet. I was about six hours under the influence of the drug, but the climax of the symptoms was reached in about an hour and a quarter, }{\fs18\cf2 [61].\{al\}
\par }{At 7 1/2 (two hours after last dose), no
ticed that he felt somewhat nervous and dizzy, and that he gave wrong change to a customer. A few minutes after, when out on an errand, felt an irresistible inclination to run; at the same time a sense of "contraction" of entire genito-urinary organs and 
g
reat desire to urinate, with much strangury on passing water; also excessive dryness of fauces, coming on suddenly and with much thirst. On returning to his place of business, found it impossible to keep still, on account of an irresistible desire to be c
o
nstantly on his feet. Within a few minutes spasms supervened, during which, at times, the flexors and extensors, at times the abductors and adductors of the whole body, were thrown into violent alternate action. While sitting in his chair, one minute his 
f
eet would beat a tattoo on the floor; and the next, his knees beat violently together. The spasms increased in severity and frequency for half an hour, and then gradually diminished, after emesis had been induced. Patient could by strong exercise of his w
i
ll, restrain the spasms; but on fresh access they were much more violent. They were unaccompanied by pain; but after a time, he experienced a sense of weariness, as after the spasms of tetanus. Patient describes his mind as being "dull" and somewhat confu
s
ed, but says that at no time did he lose consciousness in any degree. At no time any delirium. At but one time did he experience any mental disturbance, when he thought the vomitus was the head of a hippopotamus, and again a bunch of earthworms. He notice
d
 that, if anything ludicrous were said or done, or any idea suggested, which required more than common exercise of the mind, the spasms were considerably intensified. The senses of seeing and feeling were somewhat diminished. Had tinnitus aurium. Conjunct
iv\'e6 congested. Pulse, at 8.30, about 140, somewhat irregular in character and frequency, }{\fs18\cf2 [59].\{al\}
\par }{At 11 o'clock three persons had taken the liquid; on the expiration of two hours no sensible effect being produced, another dose was administered. The followi
ng are the phenomena which occurred in two of the gentlemen in the course of another half hour: Mr. A. K. resisted the action of the substance, and, as he said, experienced a slight oppression of the head and epigastrium; perhaps, also, the second repast 
w
hich he took, all these gentlemen having already breakfasted, may have entirely neutralized the substance; an examination of the state of the pulse was neglected at the beginning of the experiment; its acceleration subsequently and the state of the pupil 
s
ufficiently demonstrated the effect of the substance. Mr. B., on whom the medicine first took effect, experienced a dryness of the throat and twitching of the limbs. The pulse was 96 in the minute, the face flushed. Mr. B. soon closed his eyes in order to
 collect himself; his ideas appeared to develop with extreme rapidity. At one moment he offered the singular phenomena of a }{\i\cf2 double man}{
; he said he heard music on one side and conversation on the other; but this symptom did not continue. The music, which was
 performed by M. C., did not appear to act in any particular manner on the subject of experiment. At this time his pupils were much dilated. Interrogated as to his sensations, M. B. said they were very voluptuous. He felt particularly gay and happy; he wi
s
hed to be alone in a quiet place; he had great repugnance to speak or to move; all countenances appear to him ridiculous. Until now Mr. B. had conversed; he moved about, and sometimes laughed violently, but all this actions resembled those of a person exc
i
ted by alcoholic liquor. Suddenly he flung himself on a couch, refused to answer any more questions, and begged to be left alone, and not disturbed in the delicious sensations he experienced; he had spasmodic movements in his members, and in the diaphragm
;
 he sighed, moaned, laughed, and wept by turns; the pulse 120 a minute, the face much flushed. The persons present began to feel uneasy, but were reassured on hearing Mr. B. repeat several times that he was happy and did not suffer. Dr. Cottereau watched 
t
he symptoms with the greatest minuteness. Mr. B. appeared the whole time to have the most agreeable symptoms proceeding from the epigastrium. All the phenomena presented were those of ecstasy; his features bespoke the greatest happiness; he could not find
 
language to express his feelings; he would not wish to leave his present condition he is so happy. "How much I thank those who gave me that delicious drink." "Tell me what you feel," said one of the party, "I cannot express it." The influence of Mr. B.'s 
t
emperament was remarked throughout the experiment; he is possessed of great sensibility. In speaking of gay subjects, and pointing out lively and agreeable objects, his ideas harmonized instantly; he shouted with laughter, and evinced the greatest gayety.
 
It was evident in this case that he was under the influence of the person who spoke to him, who could direct his ideas as he chose. Mr. B.'s sense of hearing had become extremely acute; he very distinctly heard what was said far off and in a low voice. In
 
the midst of his ecstasy he neither lost consciousness of persons nor things. He replied correctly to all questions addressed to him, and knew those who surrounded him; but it was evidently painful to him to speak; he seemed to wish to enjoy his ecstasy u
n
disturbed. At half past four, the pulse is 90; his ecstatic reveries continue; he is not conscious of anything relating to earth; his mind is perfectly free, and yet he has some delicious sensations. Mr. A. De G. proposes to give him an antidote and bring
 
him back to his natural state; he says that the sensation of happiness will last a day or two. All whom I have interrogated, who have tried the experiment, have assured me that they have not felt any distress on the following days, but, on the contrary, a
 
great sensation of happiness. M. D., the second subject, came to the meeting with the conviction that the substance could not produce any effect upon him, and with the firm intention to resist its action. No symptoms occurred for two hours and a half. The
 
physiognomy of M. D. is grave. His character is serious, he rarely laughs, and devotes himself to metaphysical studies. Towards 2 o'clock his pulse was 100; his heart beat rapidly; several persons felt its pulsations. M. D., who until now had been very ca
l
m, and conversed with the company on various subjects, exclaimed the he was delirious; he began to sing, took out his pencil, and endeavoured to write down what he felt. Here are some fragments of his notes: "It is droll; my feelings are very vivid; the i
d
ea of being useful without fear, made me decide on taking this excellent drink. I am singular; they are laughing at me; I will not write any more." He threw away his paper; his delirium increased. The features of M. D. became very flexible; he laughs sard
o
nically; the expression of his eye is animated, his face red, his pulse 120, his pupils dilated. Like Mr. B., he looks extremely happy; laughs, sings, gesticulates, and speaks with extreme volubility. His ideas follow one another with rapidity; it is the 
d
erangement of gay mania. But in the midst of this abundance, mobility, and variableness of ideas, those which form the basis of his studies predominate. These serious subjects are intermixed with pleasantries, bon mots, and puns. His tongue is dry; he spi
t
s frequently; his inferior extremities are slightly convulsed. This is a very singular delirium. Like Mr. B., his hearing and sight are very acute. He has no notion of time and space, but recognizes every one present, and replies correctly to questions pu
t
 to him. He draws out his watch, and says with the greatest calmness, "It is such an hour." A multitude of ideas seem to fill his head, which he cannot express; he says, "You might take an ear, or an eye, if you could give me another tongue to make known 
w
hat I feel." The pulse lowers; it is softer, and beat but 90 in a minute. The delirium continues; water is given to him; he exclaims; "That will make the frogs come, who will drink up the liquor." Incoherent sentences follow with inconceivable rapidity. T
h
e character of the delirium changes. He seats himself in a corner, closes his eyes, and talks to himself; he looks inspired. We surround him; he talks of sciences and gives definitions; then, like a man trying his powers, he pronounces a few words, and im
m
ediately recites some twenty very harmonious verses. Being under the impression that they were some well-known stanzas, we omitted to note them down; but on some one asking him if they were not by Victor Hugo, he replied, "No!" "They are then your own?" H
e
 gave a sign of assent. His countenance expressed gayety and satisfaction; his skin became very pallid; his pulse 100; his eyes closed, which he opened on the request of his brother; the pupils less dilated. He left off improvising to speak of foreign cou
n
tries. We had been told that in these experiments the phenomena of second sight would be developed. M. D. described countries and cities which he had visited with as much correctness as though they were then before him; he perfectly recollected the peculi
a
rities which he had noticed in his travels; in like manner he told us that he saw the stones of the Pantheon at Naples, raised, and drew a very practical picture of the scene which had struck him. But notwithstanding all our questions, he could not descri

and me." He then arose, saying, "All this a dream; this state of aberration has given a livelier impulse to my ideas, but has not added to my knowledge." The delirium, which for some time had been confined to a series of ideas, now became general again; h
e sang, laughed, and talked with great vivacity; he experienced no suffering, and said he was very happy. This state lasted for four hours and a half, when I left the party. The pulse at 90; the spitting frequent, and a constant desire to drink, }{

ne of our companions, Dr. ---, who had travelled much in the East, and was a determined opium eater, was the first to yield to its influence, having taken a much larger dose than the others; he saw stars in his plate, and the firmament in his soup dish; t
h
en turning his face to the wall, talked to himself, and burst into fits of laughter, with eyes flashing, and in the highest state of glee. I felt perfectly calm until dinner was over, although the pupils of the eyes of my other friends began to sparkle st
r
angely and acquire a most singular turquoise tint. The tables being cleared, I (still having my senses) arranged myself comfortably with cushions on a divan to await the ecstasy. In a few minutes a general lethargy overcame me. My body appeared to dissolv
e
 and become transparent. I saw the hasheesh which I had eaten, distinctly within me, under the form of an emerald, form which thousands of little sparks were emitted; my eyelashes lengthened indefinitely, twisting themselves like golden threads around lit
t
le ivory wheels, which whirled about with inconceivable rapidity. Around me were figures and scrolls of all colors, arabesques, and flowing forms in endless variety, which I can only compare to the variations of the kaleidoscope. I still occasionally saw 
m
y companions; but they appeared disfigured, half men, half plants; now with the pensive air of an ibis, standing on one leg, and again as ostriches, flapping their wings, and wearing so strange an appearance that I shook with laughter in my corner; and, a
s if to join in the buffoonery of the scene, I commenced tossing up my cushions, catching them as they descended, and twisting them round with all the dexterity of an Indian juggler. One of the gentlemen addressed a discourse to me in }{\i\cf2 Italian}{
, which the has
heesh by its extraordinary power delivered to me in Spanish. Questions and answers most rational, and touched on different matters, such as the theatres and literature. The first stage drew towards, its termination. After some minutes I recovered my calmn
e
ss, without headache, or any the symptoms which accompany the use of wine, and feeling very much astonished at what had occurred, when I again fell under the influence of the hasheesh. The vision this time was more complicated and extraordinary. Millions 
o
f butterflies, whose wings rustled like fans, flew about in the midst of a confused kind of light. Gigantic flowers, with crystal calyxes, enormous hollyhocks, gold and silver lilies arose, and burst into flowers around me with a crackling sound like that
 
of bouquets of fireworks. My hearing was prodigiously developed. I heard the sound. of color; green, red, blue, and yellow sounds struck me with perfect distinctness. A glass upset, the creaking of a chair, or word spoken, however low, vibrated and resoun
d
ed like rolling thunder; my own voice appeared so loud that I dared not speak for fear of throwing down the walls or bursting like a bomb; more than five hundred clocks chimed the hour with their flutelike voices. Every object gave forth gave forth a note
 of the harmonica or \'c6olian harp. I swam in an ocean of sound, wherein some passages of the }{\i\cf2 Lucia}{ an }{\i\cf2 Barbiere}{
 floated like little isles of light. Never before had I bathed in such beatitude; I was so encircled by its waves, so transported from all things ea
rthly, so lost to self, that odious, ever-present witness, that I comprehended for the first time what might be the existence of elementary spirits and angels, and souls released from this mortal coil. I was as a sponge in the midst of the sea; every inst
a
nt waves of happiness washed over me, entering and departing through the pores; for I had become permeable, and even to the smallest capillary vessel my whole being was filled with the color of the fantastic medium in which I was plunged. Sounds, perfumes
 
and light reached me by multitudes of beams, delicate as a hair, through which I heard the magnetic current pass. According to my calculation this state must have lasted for three hundred years, for the sensations succeeded each other so numerously and po
w
erfully that the real appreciation of time was impossible. When the attack was over, I perceived that it had lasted a quarter of an hour. What is very curious in the intoxicating effect of the hasheesh is that it is not continuous; it comes and goes sudde
n
ly, raises you to heaven and places you again on earth, without any gradual transition; like madness, it has its lucid intervals. A third attack, the last and strangest, terminated my Oriental soiree. In this my sight was doubled. Two images of each objec
t
 were reflected on my retina, and produced a complete symmetry; but soon, the magic paste being entirely digested, acted with more power on my brain, and I became completely mad for the space of an hour. All kinds of Pantagruelic dreams passed through my 
f
ancy; goat-suckers, storks, striped geese, unicorns, griffins, nightmares, all the menageries of monstrous dreams, trotted, jumped, flew, or glided through the room. These wore horns terminating in foliage, webbed hands; whimisical beings, with the feet o
f
 the arm-chair for legs, and dial-plates for eyeballs; enormous noses dancing the Cachuca, mounted on chickens' legs. For myself, I imagined I was the paroquet of the Queen of Sheba, and imitated, to the best of my ability, the voice and cries of that int
e
resting bird. The visions became so grotesque that I was seized with a desire to sketch them, which I did in five minutes, with inconceivable rapidity, on the backs of letters, cards, or any pieces of paper on which I could lay my hands. One of them is th
e
 portrait of Dr. ---, as he appeared to me seated at the piano, dressed as a Turk, with a sun painted on the back of his vest. The notes are represented escaping from the instrument in the form of guns ans spirals, capriciously intertwisted. Another sketc
h
 bears this inscription; "An animal of hereafter." It represents a living locomotive, with a swan's neck terminating in the jaws of a serpent, whence issue jets of smoke, with two monstrous paws composed of wheels and pulleys; each pair of paws has a pair
 
of wings, and on the tail of the animal is seated the Mercury of the ancients, who is confessing himself to be conquered, notwithstanding his heels. Thanks to hasheesh, I have painted from nature the portrait of a goblin. Even now I fancy I hear them whin
ing and mowing at night in my old buffet, }{\fs18\cf2 [28].\{al\}
\par }{For two hours no results at all were experienced. At this time a dryness seemed to commence at a particular spot in the throat, and a feeling of warmth throughout the abdomen. These were not the results of
 disordered sensation, for a clammy mucus soon began to be secreted, though the huskiness of the throat still remained. Up to this time there was not the slightest excitement or confusion of thought. Suddenly, however, an idea, having no connection with t
h
e train of thought passing in the mind at the time, appeared, as though suggested by another person, and then was gone again as suddenly as it came, leaving upon the mind the same feeling as when one escapes from a dream or a deep revery. The same thing w
a
s repeated two or three times, at intervals rapidly diminishing in length. Even now I can hardly believe but it was the result of strained attentions to my physical sensations, for the gentle warmth of the abdomen was rapidly becoming a burning heat; stil
l
, however, not by any means unpleasant, and the dryness of the throat extended to the tongue. I had taken this drug with great skepticism as to its reputed action, or at any rate, that it was greatly exaggerated, and I accordingly made up my mind not to b
e
 "caught napping" in this way again, and to keep careful watch over my thoughts. But while enforcing this resolution, as I supposed, I found myself, to my own astonishment, waking from a revery longer and more profound than any previous. From skepticism t
o
 the fullest belief of all I had read, was but a step. Its effects so far surpassed anything which words can convey, that I began to think I was on the verge of narcotic poison; yet, strange to say, there was not the slightest feeling of inquietude on tha
t
 account. I resolved to walk into the street. While rising from the chair, another lucid interval showed that another dream had come and gone. While passing through the door, I was aware of having wandered again, but how or when I had permitted myself to 
f
all into the revery, I was perfectly unconscious, and knew only that it seemed to have lasted an interminable length of time. These singular attacks of mental disturbance recurred often, and lasted longer, till the lucid interval between them was reduced 
t
o a mere instant's conscious duration of thought. This condition came on so rapidly, that in less than fifteen minutes from the time of my being aware of the first mental disturbance, the power of controlling the thoughts was almost completely lost. All i
d
eas of time and space were especially bewildered, and I realized completely for the first time the idea of some metaphysicians, that time, properly speaking, has no existence except in connection with a succession of mental operations or sensations. The m
o
st trivial circumstance, the slightest noise, gave rise to trains of thought, which went bounding from subject to subject, completely emancipated from the rules which ordinarily govern mental operations, till suddenly some other circumstance would give an
 entirely new direction to them, and the last series of imaginations would seem to have lasted from eternity, even while the eye was fixed upon the clock, the hand of which had not perceptibly moved.
\par Now a phenomenon still more singular, began to exhibit it
self. I felt that, in spite of all exertions, I was beginning to receive the suggestions of a disordered fancy for real objective facts. Intellectually, I know that the spinal column could not be a barometer, in which mercury had usurped the place of the 
s
pinal cord. Yet in another sense, over which the operations of the intellect were entirely powerless, I felt that it was a barometer. An unpleasant sensation in the lumbar region suggested the idea of a heavy column of mercury pressing upon, it, and at th
e
 time, and under the circumstances, the transition to the idea of a barometer was easy and natural. There was no balancing of arguments in the arrival at this conclusion; there was no half-way period of doubt and uncertainty, to emerge into full credence.
 
At the instant the idea occurred at all, it commanded the assent with the same fulness as when in perfect mental health does the idea of our own existence. The thought certainly occurred that it was a delusion, but it made no more impression than the sugg
e
stion would, that the sense of sight was a figment of the brain, and objects seen had no existence, except in the imagination. This belief was not a transient one; it was the first hallucination to appear, and continued with varying degrees of intensity, 
a
s the thoughts were more or less occupied with other objects, till all others had disappeared. The belief in the reality of the vision was never for an instant absent; it pervaded the whole being, and was often the point on which the thoughts turned seemi
ngly for a long time.
\par The painful attempt to regulate these disturbed states of consciousness, was soon given up, and half involuntarily, half by a species of moral compulsion, the whole psychical nature surrendered itself withou
t further struggle, to the fullest and most complete belief in the actual existence of a thousand hallucinations. During this time the thoughts were becoming more and more disordered; ideas, between which, apparently, there was not the slightest connectio
n
, thrust themselves in, till finally their rapid occurrence, and the loss of that sense of governing the mind which we ordinarily possess, induced the belief that I was the victim of diabolical agency; that some terrible demon had taken possession of my w
h
ole intellectual being, and identified himself with every thought, in the same way that a man might direct the physical movements of a child. The feeling of utter powerlessness to check the wild current of thought was complete, and there was a sensation a
s
 though, if there had been the ability, the will could not be exercised. The firmest intentions were forgotten in an instant. There seemed to be no difference between the idea and the expression of it in words. A moment was long enough to forget whether i
t
 had been expressed or not. The sound of persons whispering in the room, brought with it the belief that they were laying some plot. It was not a vague suspicion that they were intending some injury, such as whispers and glances might excite in any one, b
ut everything they had said, the particulars of the whole plot, were present, with the same vividness and overpowering conviction as they always are in true hallucinations. The }{\i\cf2 fantasia}{
 had now arrived at its height. It was an hour and a half since the firs
t sensation of excitement and wandering commenced. About the same time passed before it had completely subsided. The mental phenomena in this stage were as remarkable as while the effects were coming on. One after another the delusions disappeared as rapi
dly as they came; not by any exercise of the gradually returning regularity of thought, but suddenly, with a bound, so that it was surprising to have believed a moment before what now appeared so absurd, }{\fs18\cf2 [52].\{al\}
\par }{\i\cf2 Majoun}{ produces effects like }{\i\cf2 laughing-gas}{, 
except that they last for many hours. Some cry, some laugh, some fall into drowsy listlessness; some are rendered talkative and funny. They see visions, imagine themselves reduced to poverty, or become emperors and commanders of armies, the natural dispos
i
tion predominating in the derangement. Men under its influence were pointed out to me in the streets. They walked along with fixed eye, heedless of all around them. Some take it daily in small quantities, producing, as one of them described it, "a comfort
able state of mind," without appearing to impair the general health. Under its influence the mouth is parched; it is not in their power to spit; their eyes become red and small; they are ravenous for food. A young English clergyman took some }{\i\cf2 
Majoun}{ as a swe
etmeat. Some hours passed without any visible effects, when a musician, who had the faculty of strangely distorting his features, came in dressed as a mummer. The clergyman took him for the devil, and a most laughable scene ensued. Next morning, on inquir
i
es after his health, he said he had slept soundly and agreeable, "as the windows and doors were bolted." Later in the day the effect disappeared entirely, and he seemed to recollect the circumstances with a confused pleasure, describing various things tha
t
 had never happened. In my case I fancied my head an inverted pendulum, which it cost me a great deal of labor to keep straight, when I could resist no longer, and let it go, and it went back as if a blow had been discharged. I struggled against each rela
p
se out of a sense of politeness towards the company, of which I did not fail to inform them, notwithstanding their roars of laughter. The back of my neck was a pivot; there was a heavy upper weight on the top of my head, and the pendulum was swinging betw
e
en my legs; but the pendulum was attracted upwards to the table, and I had to struggle to keep it down by keeping my head up. The swinging fit was accompanied by bursts of laughter. I derived great pleasure from allowing my head to go back; but the laught
e
r was unlike any mortal merriment; it seemed as never to end, and to press me, and to lead up to a mountain-top. When any one put his hand behind my head, fearing the effect of the jerks, ot that I should throw the chair over, I was very much annoyed, bec
a
use it disturbed, as I said, "the isochronism of the oscillations." I afterwards saw a similar effect produced on a European who did not know what he had taken. He was constantly throwing back his head and looking at the ceiling, and exhibited no other sy
m
ptom, which only made this the more ludicrous. After keeping the party for four hours in a state of continual convulsion, I became irresistibly drowsy, and was moved away to bed. This operation sickened me, and brought on a slight vomiting. The instant I 
w
as in bed I fell asleep, and slept without intermission for nine hours; and then awoke, perfectly recovered and fresh, with a feeling of lightness, and in high spirits. One of the most remarkable effects was that it seemed to lay bare your inmost thoughts
,
 and to present a mirror on which was reflected every act of your life, and that you were constrained to reveal and confess it all. One describes the effects on a party thus: "We were eight, and seven took to laughing, and one to crying, and the more he c
r
ied the more we laughed, and the more we laughed the more he cried, and so we spent the night, and in the morning we went to bed." The master of a Portuguese vessel to whom it was given without his being aware of its nature, thought himself bewitched, and
 
his crew were on the point of securing him as deranged. He saw a ship stranded on the bar, and ordered out his boats to her assistance; he then saw the devil cooking in the caboose, and with the demeanor of an insane person, was all the while reasoning on
 the evidences of his insanity, }{\fs18\cf2 [64].\{al\}
\par }{At 6.58 P.M. I took 0.6 gram of Egyptian Hasheesh, and half an hour after 0.4 gram in addition. Before taking, pulse 72, at 7.10, pulse 80. First sensation, pendulum-like oscillations in the head. 7.20, pulse 84; a 
feeling of flow of blood towards the upper part of head, and a strange sensation of contraction, and a kind of collapse within myself; the pendulum-like oscillations in the head increasing. 7.40, an irresistible inclination to laugh, loud laughter, withou
t
 any particular cause, tendency to rapid movements; pulse 84. I took several quick turns up and down the room, and then sat down. 7.55, a feeling of heat and pricking in the head, sensation of coldness and numbness in the extremities, which are cold to th
e
 touch, and an indefinite feeling of melancholy and uneasiness; occasional starts, without any visible cause, like those of electric shocks; pulse 96. Playing on the piano, performed by one of those present, produced a magical effect; it seemed as if the 
s
ounds were wafted from a great distance, that every sound had its peculiar life, a special fulness and expressiveness; the sounds seemed to come with fearful rapidity from an endless distance, and to be reflected immediately in the ear; in a word, an ordi
n
ary performance seemed equal to that of some eminent pianist, and I thought myself a refined and profound connoisseur, calmly enjoying the playing of some distinguished musician. 8.10, pulse 104, full; the sensation of heat in the head and pricking in the
 
temples increased; I seemed to hear a loud noise, like that of a waterfall; suddenly the nature of the noise changed, and it seemed to proceed from a number of vehicles driving in the street; then again the noise became like what is heard at the close of 
a performance at a theatre, the rumbling of vehicles, shouts of men, all combining into one general roar; these sounds suddenly disappeared, and give place to the booming of cannon, and reports of guns at a man\'9c
uvre. I cut these sensations short by the forc
e of my will, and took a quick turn in the room. I felt a violent thirst. After drinking a glass of water, I sat down on the sofa, and closed my eyes at 8.30. Scarcely had I done so, when I felt a remarkable buoyancy and flexibility in all my body; before
 
my eyes appeared a whole series of variously-tinted luminous figures, rapidly vanishing; their shapes being in the highest degree undefined; then appeared a row of more or less well-defined shapes. The most varied and most luxuriant pictures of nature eve
r
 seen by me in reality or in drawings, transported me into a magical world; I thought I was in some virgin forests of South America, then in some cities of Switzerland, and then amidst the ocean, and again amongst heaps of ice and snow, etc. An entire ser
i
es of reminiscences of childhood, the faces of friends and acquaintances, and the faces (known to me by portraits) of authors, savants, poets, politicians, etc., all these became blended in my head, presenting a kind of phantasmagoria, and the most varieg
a
ted picture. All these sensations passed rapidly and distinctly before me and I felt so enraptured that I begged to be allowed to plunge into this fantastic world, and to leave off dictating my feelings. This state lasted till 9.20. During this time those
 
who were present observed that my face was hot, red, and moist; pulse 108. On my recovery, I got up with the intention of walking across the room, but noticed that my gait was unsteady, and that I was swerving to the left, and that the upper and lower ext
r
emities of my left side were benumbed. I drank a little water and wine. At 9.45 I experienced sharp and occasionally shooting pains in the loins and in the region of the kidneys. These pains, as well as a feeling of nausea, made my state very uncomfortabl
e
; I endeavored to induce vomiting by tickling the root of the tongue, but did not succeed. It was nearly midnight when I sat down to supper, and ate with a great appetite. At 1 A.M. I went to bed, and my first sensation was that I was flying from an enorm
o
us rock into a fearful and dark abyss. I fell asleep at once, and slept very soundly. It was 11.30 A.M. when I awoke, with a feeling of heaviness in the head, with full remembrance of the previous day, and a sensation of emptiness and incapacity for thoug
h
t. Whatever I did appeared endlessly long; my words, and the conversation of others, seemed too prolonged, whereas in reality it appeared that I spoke as usual. I went out into the street to take an airing, but the farther I went the more it seemed to me 
t
hat I was walking a very long time, and that the houses and people were all flying away from me. Making an effort over myself, I took the first vehicle and drove back home. On my arrival, I at once lay down and slept till evening. On awaking I felt much l
i
velier. The urine which I had collected during the experiment had a peculiar odor, something like that of Cannabis indica. During the day, according to my own observation, as well as that of others, my face was exceedingly pale, the pupils dilated, the ex
pression that of great illness. It was only on the next day that I was able to take to my ordinary occupations, }{\fs18\cf2 [63].\{al\}

\par }{The editor has deemed it expedient to retain the natural grouping and sequence of the following affects, recorded by Dr. Edgar Holden in his work
 on the sphygmograph (Philadelphia, 1874), thus preserving the association of some general symptoms with the condition of the pulse.
\par 9.15 P.M. Feeling vigorous and well. First tracing normal, smooth, and even (not recorded), 5 grains taken.
\par 9.35. A feeling of lightness perceptible. (Tracing 181.) Two records, at 0\'b0 and 2 1/2\'b0. [These degrees refer to the pressure of the instrument on the artery, regulated at will; 0\'b0 equals 100 grammes; 2 1/2\'b0 equals 186 grammes; 5\'b0
 equals 690 grammes.] *Diminished frequency.
\par 10 P.M. Nervous and excited. (Tracing 182.) Two recorda at 4 1/2\'b0. Oscillation singularly marked; tension increased; amplitude and frequency diminished.
\par 10.05 P.M. Sudden freedom from any unusual feeling. (Tracing 183.) Two records showing a sudden return of, or rather approach to, a normal condition.
\par 10.15 P.M. 7 grains more.
\par 10.40 P.M. Excited. (Tracing 184.) Record at 2 1/2\'b0 shows capillary resistance and wave of recoil.
\par 11.45 P.M. (Tracing 185.) Two records at 2 1/2\'b0 and 0\'b0 gave similar results, indicating venous impletion. Frequency increased.
\par 11.50 P.M. Drowsy and calm. (Tracing 186.) Record at 2 1/2\'b0.
\par 11.55 P.M. (Tracing 187.) Record at 2 1/2\'b0, both the latter exhibit impaired propulsive power of the heart.
\par Total amount, 12 grains within two hours.
\par November 2d, 1872, 9.15 P.M. 30 drops.
\par 9.15 P.M. Beginning to feel an indefinable sensation of comfort. 9.20, 9.25, and 9.45 P.M. (Tracing 188.) Records all taken at the same pressure. At the latter hour the amplitude began to show increase of tension.
\par 9.45 P.M. 40 drops more.
\par 10 P.M. Slightly exhilarated. 10.15. Somewhat drowsy. Tracings at 9.50, 10 (tracing 189), and 10.15 P.M. (tracing 190) exhibit only increase of tension, with, at the latter hour, diminished frequency equal to ten beats.
\par 10.20 and 10.25 P.M. (Tracing 191.) Tension and frequency variable.
\par 10.25 P.M. All effects apparently gone. 40 drops more.
\par 10.45 P.M. Again exhilarated. (Tracing 192.) Records exhibit great increase of arterial tension.
\par 11 P.M. drowsy, but not pleasantly so, nor as if from desire to sleep. (Tracing 193.) Frequency greatly increased, equal to thirty beats and falling in five minutes as many; tension less.
\par 11.05 P.M. (Tracing 194.) Record shows increased cardiac excitement at beginning of systole, with some obstruction, either proximate or distal.
\par Total amount, 110 drops.
\par November 5th, 1872, 9 P.M. Feeling well. 100 drops. Tracing normal.
\par 9.10 P.M. (Tracing 195.) Amplitude, and therefore tension increased, frequency steadily diminishing till 9. 45. Tracings at 9.30, 9.45.
\par 10 P.M. No effects experienced. 120 drops more.
\par 10.10 P.M. (Tracing 196.) Diminished tension and the oscillation of cerebro-spinal implication. This tracing, by accident in transfer, fails to show this except in the first wave.
\par 10.15 P.M. Same.
\par 10.35 P.M. (Tracing 197.) Obstruction either proximate or remote.
\par 10.40. (Similar to tracing 195.) Diminishing obstruction.
\par 10.45 P.M. Very little effect. 200 drops more.
\par 11.15 P.M. (Tracing 198.) Diminished tension and evident sedation, but frequency slightly increased.
\par 11.18 P.M. No effect whatever. Same.
\par Total amount taken, 420 drops!
\par November 9th, 1872, 9.50 P.M. Feeling not well as usual, owing to overwork; otherwise all right. 12 grains of fresh extract taken.
\par 10.15 P.M. A little nauseated and eyes heavy.
\par 10 and 10.15 P.M. Tracings showed diminishing frequency and tension, and not feeling well a pressure of 0\'b0 was found to be the best for observation, instead of 2 1/2\'b0 as heretofore.
\par 10.30 P.M. Feeling comfortable and well. (Tracing 199.) Frequency still less; pulse small, but normal, showing sedation.
\par 10.45. Effect passing off; pulse somewhat excited. 14 grains more taken.
\par 11.25. A few minutes exhilarated, then very drowsy, but no impairment of will.
\par 11.25 and 11.40 P.M. (Tracings 200 and 201.) Records exhibited great weakness of cardiac power, it being difficult to obtain them even at 0\'b0.
\par 11.45 P.M. Drowsiness gone, and feel free from any effect. 11.45, 11.48, and 11.50 P.M. (Tracing 202.) The records taken showed a sudden decrease of frequency and tension, and equally sudden increase.
\par 12.50. Terrific excitement, twitchings, dreams, etc.; sensations as of swelling of the head, painful insomnia and feeling of desperate recklessness.
\par November 10th. (Tracings taken the day following the use of the drug.)
\par 7.50 A.M. Peculiar action of medicine still evident, head swollen, confusion of ideas, etc. Tracings small, and showing weak heart.
\par 12.30 M. Have been asleep and feel better; influence passing off. (Tracing 203.) Same, but showing also the slight dicrotism of capillary dilatation.
\par Total amount taken, 26 grains. Time, two hours and forty minutes.\line {\*\bkmkstart synopsis}{\*\bkmkend synopsis}

\par Synopsis of the two later experiments with Cannabis Indica need not be given. It may be briefly said of them that the doses were large and repeated at nearly one hour intervals. The effect was in the fi
rst of these apparent in the tracing in ten minutes, and a steady diminution of frequency resulted, until in forty-five minutes there occurred evidence of implication of the nervous system. In thirty-five minutes after the second dose there appeared evide
n
ce of some obstruction to circulation, either near the heart or in the capillaries, and after 420 drops had been taken, the arterial tension was greatly reduced, with corresponding increase of the venous pressure, and marked sedation, just two hours and f
ifteen minutes from the first dose, and thirty from the last and largest.
\par Finally, sudden cessation of effect.
\par In the last experiment detailed, in which a fresh alcoholic extract was again used, the following facts were noticed.
\par First. Tracings abnormal fro
m malaise at the beginning became normal in forty minutes, with marked sedation and diminished frequency. In fifty-five minutes began the stage of exhilaration, at which time a larger dose was taken. After fifty-five minutes the heart's impulsive power wa
s evidently weakened, and shortly after began a vacillation, alike of equilibrium, of pressure, and of weakness.
\par In one hour and forty-five minutes the nervous system was broken down by the excitement of reaction, a state lasting three hours.

\par Somebody advised a young, pale girl, \'e6t. fourteen years, to use the leaves of Mezereum in order to become fat and rosy. She went into the woods and made free use of them on her cheeks and surrounding parts. Burning pains soon appeared, her who
le face swelled up enormously, especially the nose, eyelids, and hairy scalp. Severe and painful sneezing, deliria, dull, unbearable, pressing pains in the forehead, a nauseous dryness in the throat, and a constant irritation to dry cough, showed that the
 
acridity of the poison by its inhalation affected the nose, and through the frontal sinuses the cerebral membranes, also pharynx and larynx. The face soon took on the expression of erysipelas bullosum, the nostrils closed, so that she could only breathe t
h
rough her mouth; febrile pulse, burning urine. After external application of oil, cold compresses, and indifferent external remedies, the swelling decreased after the second day, and desquamated in large pieces. But health did not return. Debility, loss o

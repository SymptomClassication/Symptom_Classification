\par }{Violent delirium, at night, }{\fs18\cf2 [35].\{al\}
\par }{Violent delirium set in and continued for 
some days. As the delirium declined, the mind did not recover its clearness and integrity, on the contrary, his sensations and perceptions were vitiated and erroneous. Various morbid ideas took possession of him, and some of them remained, and continued t
o manifest themselves for many months after his apparent restoration to health, }{\fs18\cf2 [561].\{al\}

\par }{Delirium, for three days (in a previous attack), }{\fs18\cf2 [222].\{al\}

\par }{Delirium, alternating with sopor, }{\fs18\cf2 [237].\{al\}
\par }{Tranquil delirium, }{\fs18\cf2 [305].\{al\}
\par }{Appeared to be rapidly recovering, when he was suddenly seized, about 11 A.M., with furious delirium, attended at intervals, by general spasms. It was astonishing to see him, who, three hours before, could only
 pronounce with difficulty a limited number of words, whose voice was weak, and whose utterance was faint and drawling, now talking incessantly, and pouring forth shouts, screams, and abuse against all who approached him. His voice was loud and clear. His
 delirium turned chiefly upon the idea that }{\i\cf2 his life was in danger from assassination or poisoning, and that every one about him was a murderer}{
. His muscular strength was increased to such a degree, that, with one hand, he could lift all his mattresses at o
nce with the greatest ease. He left his bed, and walked about briskly, knocking against every obstacle at random. His face was flushed; his eyes sparkling and fierce. At last a strait-waistcoat was put on him, which heightened his fury. Pulse, 65; heat of
 
body rather increased. The delirium lasted about half an hour, when it was succeeded by coma, during which he lay stretched out and motionless, with closed eyes and somewhat pale face. Strong stimulation could only draw forth a few unmeaning grunts. An ho
ur later, the delirium suddenly returned, to be followed again by coma, and thus, all that day and night, the opposing conditions alternated, }{\fs18\cf2 [190].\{al\}
\par }{Sudden attack of delirium, in the evening, accompanied by extreme restlessness; he railed, threatened, a
nd then fell into a deep sleep. This alternation of delirium and somnolency continued until morning; next day, face flushed and covered with sweat. Eyes fixed and expressionless; bloodshot; lids swollen; pupils, especially the right one, extremely dilated
, but moderately sensitive to light. Expression of face decidedly dull. Frequent movements, more or less forcible, of the head, limbs, and whole body; so that he had to be put into a strait-waistcoat, }{\fs18\cf2 [190].\{al\}
\par }{Did not close his eyes for a minute all night
; sometimes was silent and quiet, sometimes hurried out of bed, wanted to dress himself, and went about looking for his clothes; talked incoherently; abused the nurses and patients. In the morning, to prevent him from disturbing the ward, he was put into 
a
 strait-waistcoat. He resisted violently; struggled, called for help, screamed, bawled, and even bit an assistant who had hold of him. After this, he became quiet and silent, and his limbs ceased trembling. When I entered the room, he called to me, and be
gged to be released. He had an astonished look; something unusual seemed to have altered his expression of face, }{\fs18\cf2 [173].\{al\}
\par }{During the paroxysms of colic, he tosses and rolls about in bed, weeps and laments; his pinched-up face denotes the sharpest pain; he
 is so distracted by the agony he endures, that he can pay no attention to what passes around him, nor when asked a question, }{\fs18\cf2 [137].\{al\}
\par }{During the paroxysms, the face expresses acute pain; he is restless, rolling about in bed, screams out, etc., }{\fs18\cf2 [162].\{al\}
\par }{
During the paroxysms, he lay flat on his belly, dug his fingers into his navel, tied himself tightly in his cravat, uttered dismal screams, declared that he had to go to stool; sometimes got up and walked the room hurriedly, his hands pressed to his abdo
men; we have seen the poor fellow leaning on his belly against the iron railing of his bed, }{\fs18\cf2 [219].\{al\}
\par }{During the paroxysms, a condition approaching to frenzy; constant restlessness; lying on abdomen; he knelt down and crouched together in his bed, etc., }{\fs18\cf2 [211].\{al\}
\par }{During the paroxysms, which occurred almost every ten minutes, the patient, suffering the greatest anxiety, his face all distorted, rolled about in bed uttering dismal groans; he laid his pillow over his abdomen and begged the bystanders to press
 upon it with all their force; this afforded temporary relief. He bits the sheets, his limbs writhed; at times he might have been taken for a furious madman, }{\fs18\cf2 [209].\{al\}
\par }{During the paroxysms, screaming, tossing about, and assuming the strangest attitudes, }{\fs18\cf2 [122].\{al\}
\par }{During the paroxysms, the face is contracted; he screams aloud, sticks his legs suddenly out of bed, etc., }{\fs18\cf2 [131].\{al\}
\par }{
Between the paroxysms, mind often much affected. Would leave home without knowing where he was going; became enraged with persons he met; and generally remembered nothing of what had occurred. When brought home, he would shut himself up until he got right
 again. One day, he left home to enter the Hospital Beaujon; got lost, and was quite surprised to find himself at La Piti\'e9, }{\fs18\cf2 [521].\{al\}
\par }{Although naturally patient of suffering, he was importunate, nay clamorous for relief, expressing himself in terms of agony, far stronger than his general appearance and symptoms seemed to warrant, }{\fs18\cf2 [284].\{al\}
\par }{When admitted he refused to go to bed, tore his shirt off, and spoke disconnectedly, }{\fs18\cf2 [439].\{al\}
\par }{With loud cries, he insists upon going to stool, }{\fs18\cf2 [122].\{al\}
\par }{Bites his garments and bedclothes, }{\fs18\cf2 [208].\{al\}
\par }{Begged and prayed to be released from the strait-waistcoat, "for," he said, "I am not mad; but the idea of being forcibly restrained is enough to drive me crazy," }{\fs18\cf2 [172].\{al\}
\par }{At times, the pains became so violent that he weeps and laments; and his whole frame is agitated, }{\fs18\cf2 [132].\{al\}
\par }{Difficulty in putting him to bed; he tore off the clothes, and spoke incoherently, }{\fs18\cf2 [440].\{al\}
\par }{Started out of bed as if beside himself, compressing his abdomen with his hands, }{\fs18\cf2 [120].\{al\}
\par }{Hung on to the bedpost, and kept swaying himself with a convulsive movement, }{\fs18\cf2 [120].\{al\}
\par }{He keeps thrusting his limbs out of bed, and then covering them up again, }{\fs18\cf2 [136].\{al\}
\par }{Frightful screams, with general convulsions, }{\fs18\cf2 [56].\{al\}
\par }{Screaming out, at intervals, }{\fs18\cf2 [203].\{al\}
\par }{Uttered piercing cries, }{\fs18\cf2 [120].\{al\}
\par }{Screaming, }{\fs18\cf2 [215].\{al\}
\par }{Screaming incessantly, }{\fs18\cf2 [223].\{al\}
\par }{Utters doleful groans, and screams loudly for relief, }{\fs18\cf2 [208].\{al\}
\par }{During the aggravations, he screams, draws himself together under the bedclothes, suddenly gets out of bed, then gets in again, and doubles himself up, etc., }{\fs18\cf2 [209].\{al\}
\par }{During the intervals of quietude, which were very brief, he kept up a sort of continual grumbling, closed his eyes, and shrunk down under the bedclothes, }{\fs18\cf2 [212].\{al\}
\par }{In the nig
ht, began to talk to himself quite incoherently, about all sorts of things; then left his bed, and wanted to lie down in another bed in the room. The nurse easily got him back to his own quarters; his gait was firm, and he had no tremor; his eyes were wid
e
 open, somewhat projecting and fixed. His face had an expression of astonishment. During the rest of the night, he talked much to himself; his delirium was mild and quiet. Next day, his expression was natural, and he had the use of all his faculties, but 
h
e seemed to take little interest in conversation, and his manner was remarkably listless. About 5 P.M., he began fairly to rave; would keep chattering for several minutes, and then be silent for awhile. His face had a wild expression, which struck the hou
se surgeon on duty. Pulse, 85; no fever. Worse at night; took part in all the conversation he heard, or fancied he heard, }{\fs18\cf2 [185].\{al\}
\par }{On the fifth day of the delirium, in the afternoon, he had a sudden attack of epilepsy, characterized by violent convulsive 
movements of the whole body, bloody froth at the mouth, biting the tongue, interrupted breathing, etc. After an attack, which lasts about half an hour, he becomes slightly comatose, but soon rouses, and enters again into delirium. On the sixth day of the 
d
elirium, the general aspect of the countenance was more unnatural than before. There was less of that harmony of expression which is indicative of a well-balanced mind. Sometimes the eyes were fixed and the features concentrated; sometimes the former seem
e
d to roll about, under the influence of serious thought, and the whole face to partake of this meditative look. He would still sometimes burst into laughter at the most unexpected moments. The limbs trembled, or rather, were shaken by slight spasms, which
 
also ran over the face in different directions, coming and going at irregular intervals. The tongue was considerably swollen, from having been bitten during the epileptic seizures of the preceding day; utterance also was impeded, being stammering, hurried
,
 and abrupt; an effect to which the slight spasms above spoken of also contributed. He was sometimes conscious of his condition, and said that he was insane. His talk became irrational more frequently, and continued so longer than on the day before. Yet e
v
en now, his intellectual aberration could only be discovered by very attentive observation. On the seventh day of the delirium, he talked much to himself, and tried to get into the neighboring beds; he wandered more in his speech; wanted to strike the nur
s
e, without provocation; when threatened with the strait-waistcoat, he quieted down somewhat. He often talked to himself at night; what he said was incongruous, disconnected, and about all sorts of things. He got up three or four times, and tried to fold h
i
s bedstead together, under the impression that he was working some sort of machine; then he laid down again. Twice he rose from bed, walked about with bare feet, and urinated in the middle of the floor; next minute, he fancied one of the patients called t
o
 him, ran headlong to help him, and got into another bed at the opposite side of the room. His sight was unimpaired, his gait firm and confident. At times, he was silent and quiet, although he never closed his eyes. On the eighth day of delirium, he was q
u
iet, but, in conversation, more decidedly irrational than on the day before. He spoke to others with a smiling face; he was silent and looked very thoughtful. Now and then, he perceived that he had used a wrong word, as was shown, by his impatient gesture
s
, and he tried to recall the proper one; he talked to himself about all sorts of things. If he was spoken to so as to attract his attention strongly, and the questions were simple, and easily answered, his replies were rational. He talked no more sensibly
 
about one thing than another. Even to-day, although not so apparent as yesterday, there was always, amid his delirious ravings, a certain semblance of good sense. The utterance is, as it were, spasmodic; more abrupt and jerky than on the day before; words
 are pronounced rapidly and incompletely, }{\fs18\cf2 [196].\{al\}
\par }{Out of his head, at times; at night, quite delirious, talked almost constantly; got out of bed; looked for his clothes, in order to dress himself; ran all about the room, trying to get into the other pati
ents' beds; at last, after he had gone on in this way a good while, it was found necessary to put him in a strait-waistcoat, to which he submitted quietly. Next day, his eyes were wide open; his expression was rather wild. When alone, he talked much to hi
m
self, sometimes calmly, sometimes violently; generally about wine, which he would not take part in smuggling into the hospital. Sometimes he fancied himself at his foundry, at home, or in the street, etc. His conversation was a mixture of sense and extrav
a
gance. When his attention was strongly attracted to anything, what he said was at first rational, then he would suddenly drop the subject, and begin to talk about something quite different, mixing together in this way a great many ideas and incoherent wor
ds. But, on peremptorily recalling his thoughts to the topic gambolled from, he would again answer pertinently and sensibly for awhile, }{\fs18\cf2 [184].\{al\}
\par }{After trying in vain to find his clothes, he got up and walked the room, but with hesitating step, and feeling
 about with his hands, like one groping in the dark; runs against the stove, the beds, etc.; sometimes uttered incoherent words, or called for his wife, or his friends; wanted to talk about his business; often said "My wife! my wife!" more frequently was 
s
ilent. At last he became quiet, soon got into bed again, and seemed to fall into a deep sleep. After awhile, would rouse up and begin to act in the same way again. Once he was about to urinate upon the stand which held the patient's diet-drink. Sometimes 
h
e spoke rationally, but generally poured forth unintelligible words in a trembling and hurried voice. He talked to those about him, and made the most incongruous demands upon them. He was not violent, and threatened nobody. Now and then he put his hands t
o
 his forehead or abdomen, his face contracted, he groaned and exclaimed "My God! my God!" then began to cry like a child. Sometimes he was observed to lie down on his abdomen. Constant sleeplessness. Delirium and restlessness, worse at night. Recognized t
h
ose about him, and maintained a long conversation tolerably well; but, when a drunken patient happened to say to him, in an offensive tone, "They will put you in a strait-waistcoat, you old lunatic!" he became furious, stamped his feet, shook his fists, w
e
pt, etc.; poured forth a multitude of words. In a quarter of an hour, he became quiet again, and soon after slept a little. Being visited by his wife, he at first received her roughly, and loaded her with abuse; then suddenly began to caress her, and seem
ed greatly pleased with the visit, }{\fs18\cf2 [186].\{al\}
\par }{His facial expression does not at all times correspond with the character of the conversation he is engaged in, nor with the other external influences which surround him. Thus, he will sometimes burst out laughi
ng, while speaking of some very ordinary matter, or look serious and thoughful while answering the most simple question. Yet quite often his face wears its natural expression. At first he would not be taken for a victim of cerebral disease; he is very qui
e
t, and seems quite rational. But gradually as the conversation proceeds, he loses the thread of his ideas, and talks mere nonsense, or keeps contradicting himself most shockingly. When alone, he does not talk to himself. He eats, drinks, urinates, and goe
s
 to stool, as properly as anybody; sometimes he gets up to visit other patients in the next ward; the latter do not at first perceive that his intellect is at all affected, but when the hint is given them by the physicians, they soon declare that he talks
 wildly, }{\fs18\cf2 [196].\{al\}
\par }{Rose from bed in the night, and tied to get into his neighbor's bed; took a cravat from me; a pair of trousers from another; walked as if groping in the dark, and bruised himself against the stove, washstand, etc.; talked to himself; at 
last the warden managed to get him into bed again. Quiet during the rest of the night; but every now and then wanted his neighbors to give him "}{\i\cf2 his drop}{
." Next day, face wild; eyes wide open; by turns fixed and wandering. Abdomen nowhere painful on pressure. Kept trying to get up in order to take his "}{\i\cf2 drop}{," and called to the other patients, "}{\i\cf2 Make haste and get up}{
." His limbs were tremulous. His constant efforts to get out of bed made it necessary to put him in a strait-waistcoat; he struggled hard against 
it, screamed, howled, uttered threats; became red with passion, and tried in every way to break loose; called out to the passers by and begged them to set him free. During the day, he was sometimes quiet and silent; sometimes furious at the thought of bei
ng tied. He was never sleepy. Fancied, at times, that he heard delightful music, which soothed his sorrows, }{\fs18\cf2 [187].\{al\}
\par }{His utterance is drawling, difficult and frequently broken; so that he talks like a child who has not learned to speak plainly; instead of "}{\i\cf2 oui}{," for example, he says "}{\i\cf2 ui}{
." Sometimes he cannot get hold of the right word; then he frets and worries himself, and now and then becomes quite desperate. This difficulty seems to be met with chiefly in the case of }{\i\cf2 substantives}{; with adjectives, the i
ntellect and organs of speech deal more easily, }{\fs18\cf2 [195].\{al\}
\par }{His colic was almost cured, when the nurses and his fellow-patients observed that his intellect was affected, and that he wandered in his speech, but to so slight an extent, that the aberration esc
aped the notice of the medical attendants. He lay quiet, with closed eyes, as if in a peaceful sleep; when pinched as hard as possible he showed no sign of sensibility. When the fingers, hands, forearms, or arms were placed in any position, and left unsup
p
orted, they remained there for a few seconds, then oscillated a little, and fell back on the bed. This experiment was repeated several times, with the same result. The body was rigid, so that he could not be made to sit upright, and his attention could no
t
 be aroused for a moment. Suddenly he began to make a great variety of the most expressive gestures, at first with one arm only, but soon the other arm, the legs, trunk, head and face, all took part in these movements, which were performed in co-ordinatio
n
, and seemed to express the same idea. Every moment he appeared to be possessed by the most dissimilar and grotesque conceptions, which he embodied in this way. At the same time he cried out, and tried to speak, but was prevented by the liquid in his mout
h
. If, at this time, he was gently pinched, he showed by an abrupt movement, that he felt acutely. The upper limbs no longer remained fixed in any position they were placed in; they were too stiff to be moved at all. After the movements had lasted some min
u
tes, they were succeeded by a state of absolute quietude, and he lay just as he done before they commenced; then they began again, to be again followed by a period of repose, and so on, in alternation. Now, he indicated, by a significant gesture, that he 
d
esired to eat and drink; now he suddenly spouted the ptisan, which he had been holding in his mouth, all over the surgeon in attendance. Then came an interval of quiet and unconsciousness, during which his limbs remained in any position they were made to 
a
ssume. Next was witnessed a series of the most expressive gestures, although he kept his eyes shut, and uttered not a single word. Their significance is constantly varying; sometimes they seem to indicate rage, sometimes despair, sometimes entreaty, somet
i
mes the most profound meditation. At last he suddenly opened his eyes, called for drink; then seemed to fall asleep again while swallowing his ptisan, but is easily aroused by being spoken to; then he opened his eyes fully, began to talk about his mother,
 
and while rambling volubly from one incoherent idea to another, still answered questions rationally. Left to himself, he talked incessantly, followed up an idea for a minute or two, and then left it for another. At one time he became much agitated, tried 
t
o get up, addressed the doctors, abused them, tried to strike and bite the nurses when restrained; and at last, shouting and struggling, was put into a strait-waistcoat. On the second day of the delirium, he was lying quiet, with eyes half open. Soon he a
r
oused completely, began to talk very fast, and at first answered questions rationally. But after conversing a few minutes, his thoughts became confused, and he began to ramble and talk to himself. By attracting his attention again, he could be brought bac
k
 to the original topic, then got off the track again, and so forth; so that his talk was a mixture of sense and nonsense. He was frequently influenced by the most grotesque delusions; he fancied that a cavalry regiment was about to fall upon him; or that 
h
e was in the presence of his employer, who was finding fault with him. His face looked rather wild; at times he bursts out laughing. His head was full of notions. He recollected very well what happened a month or more ago; but could not call to mind thing
s that occurred only a few days before his delirium set in, }{\fs18\cf2 [199].\{al\}
\par }{He seems to recognize familiar acquaintances; sometimes he talks unintelligibly to himself; more frequently is silent. When his attention is strongly attracte

\par }{During the evening of the seventh day, suddenly great restlessness; he hears everywhere threatening voices, officers come to arrest him, to seize his furniture, and to expel him from his lodgings; the voic

the eyes fixed steadily to the window, or looking about in a restless manner; he recognizes all persons around him, replies correctly to all questions, but cannot recollect what he ate yesterday, whether his bowels moved or not, and looks to his wife in a

 cachectic look; cheeks hollow and pale; yellow complexion; no signs of lead poisoning, aside from the cerebral symptoms. Yet this case is not one of encephalopathy in any form. It is a chronic affection of the mind, which we must try to describe in order
 
to characterize it. He is absorbed in himself; pays no attention to what goes on about him. He does not converse with his neighbors; when questioned he answers rationally, indeed, but briefly. When his wife and children come to see him, he pays no attenti
o
n to them, and goes on with what he is about, as if they were not present; yet he says he is fond of them, and seems to think a good deal of their visits. He has never shown any irritability. When in bed he keeps moving his hands; folds and unfolds the co
v
erings. Sometimes he gets up and wanders about the room, now singing, now gradually quickening his steps, as if impelled by an irresistible force, now stopping and turning about abruptly; his gait is uncertain. His behavior is nearly the same day and nigh

\par }{The cerebral functions were strangely disturbed. Variou
s hallucinations showed themselves. Erroneous ideas were formed as to the identity of herself and those around her, and the situation in which she was placed. A mild, but easily controlled form of delirium arose. For some days this alternated with a diffe
r
ent state; if she attempted to speak to those around her, she seemed to have difficulty in finding language, and before she could succeed in conveying her meaning, the idea fled, and a jumble of unconnected words was all that escaped her. And now the cond
i
tion of the nervous system became one of apathy. Impressions were made upon the senses with difficulty, and speedily vanished; her attention was no sooner gained than it was lost, and she remained for hours at once in a state of semi-consciousness. At thi
s
 stage, phenomena were occasionally present approximating to those described as characteristic of catalepsy and ecstasy. On placing the arms, for example, extended in any particular position, they remained fixed in it for some minutes, and then slowly rel
a
xed and sunk down; at other times she would remain for a considerable period unconscious of anything around her, but with her eyes fixed and gazing intently before her. On one occasion, after the action of a purgative, she was for about twelve hours quite
 
insensible. She lived for five weeks after the appearance of the cerebral symptoms, and for four months from the time when her health began to break down. Before her death she was seized with convulsions of an epileptiform character, which continued with 
short intervals for forty-eight hours, and upon the cessation of which she passed into a state of complete coma and died, }{\fs18\cf2 [56].\{al\}

The patients were in a state of nervous irritability, difficult to describe. In their beds they were restless and unable to find an easy position, and after many useless efforts they fell back exhausted and worn out, with pain; the respiration became hurr

\par Gums.}{
\par The first and most frequent indication of the presence of lead in the system, is a peculiar discoloration of the gums and teeth. The gums bordering on the teeth, to the depth of one or two lines, are usually blue or slate colored, their remaining portion 
b
eing of a very light bluish-red, passing gradually into the natural hue of the buccal mucous membrane. Sometimes the discoloration spreads all over the gums, or even over the entire buccal mucous membrane. In a good many cases only the gums immediately bo
rdering on the teeth become slate-colored, in strong contrast with the natural appearances of their remaining portion. They at first assume a violet-red tinge, becoming decidedly slate-colored, sooner or later, }{\fs18\cf2 [117].\{al\}
\par }{The discolored portion of the gums 
quite often becomes considerably thinner, sometimes as thin as a sheet of note-paper; or else, as more frequently occurs, it dwindles in superficial extent. In the latter case the interdental partitions gradually disappear, and the concavity of the gums i
s
 increased, in consequence of molecular absorption, which takes place within the substance of their tissue, without visible solution of continuity. When this process of absorption is complete, the teeth are stripped of a portion of their gums, and are lai
d
 bare. The gums thus form, quite frequently, only a more or less projecting pad, sometimes marked by vertical incisions. This change in the nutrition of the gums always follows upon their discoloration. The latter, however, often disappears, in proportion
 
to the shrinking of the gums from interstitial absorption, so that what is left of them is only slightly tinged with blue. Usually the discoloration and loss of substance do not take place in both alveolar borders to the same extent. The twofold change is
 generally most marked in their anterior portion. The lower gums are apt to show rather more of it than the upper; and it sometimes happens that the gums of only two or three teeth are thus affected, }{\fs18\cf2 [117].\{al\}
\par }{The above described discoloration of the gums 
and teeth we have never observed, except in those whose buccal mucous membrane has been brought in contact with lead particles. We have examined the mouths of seven hundred and eighty-five persons who had not worked in lead compounds, or ingested them in 
any way, and in not one of them could we discover the least trace of the specific discoloration produced by sulphate of lead, }{\fs18\cf2 [117].\{al\}
\par }{The peculiar blue line on the gums, the edge of the gum where it is attached to the neck of the teeth, was fringed with 
a very distinct blue line, about one-twentieth of an inch in width, so that three or four of the molar teeth on each side in upper jaw were thus half surrounded towards the roof of the mouth with a blue crescent, }{\fs18\cf2 [236].\{al\}
\par }{The fatal line was more of less present in the gums of all; in two cases a slate-colored line was well defined, and in one of these the mucous membrane of the mouth was strewed with spots of the same color, }{\fs18\cf2 [266].\{al\}

\par Kidneys and Bladder.}{
\par Three years previously, the patient had been in the hospital with albuminuria and casts in the urine, but when discharged these symptoms had disappeared; at tha
t time he had no brain symptoms except headache; on this occasion, the urine, which was retained in the bladder and had to be drawn with a catheter, contained albumen and a large number of casts; two days subsequently there was anuria, trismus, opisthoton
o
s, convulsions followed by loss of mind; during the attack the tongue was badly bitten, the pupils contracted and indolent; on the following days the amount of urine, in spite of treatment (an infusion of squills), 600 and 700 c.cm.; the urine for twenty-
four hours contained 17 grams of urea; the patient did not have another spasm, }{\i\cf2 though he suffered from most violent pains in the upper and lower extremities}{
; after this the amount of urine increased, the urea rose to 39 and 41 grams, the albumen diminished, the pus disappeared and the mind became free, but after about two weeks he was seized with erysipelas, from which he died, }{\fs18\cf2 [548]}{
. [The post-mortem showed a very easy separation of the suprarenal capsules, the upper surface of the kidney granular, the pare
nchyma very moist, the cortical gray, somewhat reduced in size, the malpighian corpuscles not distinct, the pyramids gray. Under the microscope the kidneys presented an exquisite picture of interstitial nephritis in a rather early stage; the cortical subs
tances especially presented in both transverse and vertical sections, }{\i\cf2 great cellular hyperplasia and increase of interstitial connective tissue}{
, though the process was not equally diffused; while frequently the whole field was occupied by small cells of connective tissue with scarcely a trace of uriniferous tubes, other sections exhibited the tubercles of normal size and configuration, }{\i\cf2 
but separated by abnormally broad septa of connective tissue}{; the glomeruli presented varying characters, some normal, }{\i\cf2 others atrophied to fibrillar knots of connective tissue, and others in all possible stages of degeneration}{
. The substance of the pyramids was less affected than the cortical; the growth of connective tissue was here much less pronounced, and in many places was
 not noticed at all; the tubes were for the most part denuded of epithelium. The small arteries of the kidney showed no remarkable change; in the transverse section was seen a very broad zone of connective tissue; hyperplasia thickening of the walls and c
ontraction of the calibre of the vessels were not noticed. The intertubular capillaries in both the cortical and tubular portions of the kidney were excessively filled; in the latter there were numerous spots of h\'e6
morrhages into the urinary canals, and here and there the cativies of the urinary canals were found stopped by old plugs, and by some calcareous concretions. The liver showed analogous changes of }{\i\cf2 
hyperplasia of connective tissue, in some places even tubercular nodes of connective tissue growth}{. The
 heart showed inflammatory connective tissue growth, with chronic myocarditis; in some places very broad septa of small-celled connective tissue was formed between single muscular fibrill\'e6

ontained in the urine; the urea is from six to seven times less in quantity; the phosphoric acid, uric acid, and chlorides are less, but the coloring matters are ten to twenty times more abundant than normal. In the second period, the vomiting and colic h
a
ve disappeared, and the lead is introduced into the various organs, and acts upon their functions; the quantity of urine still remains a little below the normal point; the extractive matters are still less in quantity, the urea being only half the normal 
quantity; the same may be said of phosphoric and uric acids; the quantity of coloring matter is still very great. In the third stage there is an\'e6
mia, and the intoxication is confirmed; there is a permanent alteration of the urine, characterized by a less qu
antity and density, and notable diminution of the urea and phosphoric and uric acids; whether this diminution is dependent upon some disturbance of assimilation, or is connected with a certain degree of impermeability, is still a doubtful point; neverthel
ess, as we find double the quantity of normal excrementitious matter present in the blood, we may rather ascribe their diminution in the urine to impermeability. Lastly, to an\'e6
mia, is coupled albuminuria; the quantity of urine secreted is very variable, som
etimes approaching the normal; but the density is very low; the extractive matters are considerably diminished; and whether albuminuria exists or not, we do not observe any increase of the quantity of uric acid in the blood; nor is uric acid found in the

\par }{Having soon satisfied myself that these fi

d
 the two paralyzed fingers somewhat further, but no completely. Impressed by this peculiar attitude of the hand, which at once brought to my mind that rare affection, local lead poisoning, I mentioned my suspicions to my colleagues and the students in att
e
ndance. I questioned the patient concerning his occupation. He said he was employed in the manufacturing of certain chemical compounds, where he rinsed bottles, etc., but distinctly denied that any preparation of lead was among the ingredients used, and i
n
sisted that the same was the case as to mercury. He had never had colic, and his gums showed not the slightest trace of a lead line; but this was not inconsistent with my view of the case, under the supposition that the paralysis was due to the local and 
d
irect action of the metal. I asked him if he was right-handed. He answered in the affirmative. I then asked him to compress my hand in his right hand. He tried to comply; but that hand had no grasping power, being especially weak at its inner border; a tr
i
al with his left hand, however, gave me severe pain. The right little and ring fingers, also the inner border of the right hand and the inner half of the palm and back of the same, were completely insensible to touch, pricking, pinching, cold, and ticklin
g
; the other fingers, and the rest of the right hand, retained their natural sensibility. In spite of the patient's denial that he had been in the habit of touching lead, or of using a leaden tool, I assured him that he had been poisoned by that metal, whi
c
h he had frequently handled with the last two fingers of his right hand. In order to convince him, I told him to take a sulphur bath, which, if it should have the effect of blackening the paralyzed hand only, especially its affected parts, would show, bey
o
nd doubt, the presence of lead in his system, and the propriety of his following my advice. If otherwise, then I would confess myself mistaken. I prescribed for him 1 gram of Iod. Potass. daily; and Iodide ointment to be rubbed with the right hand. Just a
s
 he was leaving the dispensary, he turned around and remarked, that "perhaps it was capping the vials which had done the mischief." Now, if I had not stuck to my theory, this case would certainly have slipped through my fingers. Seizing the cue thus prese
n
ted, we got him to explain to us the mode in which he fitted on the leaden capsules. He applied the sheet-lead smoothly over the neck of the vial, by clasping the latter between the inner half of the palm and the last two fingers of his right hand; after 
w
orking in this way for awhile, these parts became covered with a grayish-black discoloration derived from contact with the metal. On re-examining the palm of the hand, we found two callosities on the inside of the knuckle-joints of the two paralyzed finge

left the hospital completely cured. Since then the tremor returned at varying intervals of time, but not very severely. It was worse in the morning, and he informs us that if he drank two or three glasses of brandy it would cease during the rest of the da

 some brandy to relieve this latter symptom, but did not succeed in removing it. Being now disabled from work, he entered "La Charit\'e9

some difficulty in grasping objects, but electro-muscular contractility appears to be almost unimpaired. The lower extremities are similarly affected when he is standing up. The gait is uncertain; he staggers in his walk. The head also trembles perceptibl

ind ordinarily followed, or could be induced by natural effort. Yet there was at that time no excessive constipation. This uneasiness, or these sensations, were not constant, but grew in frequency, the pain gradually creeping round to the lumbar region, w
h
en it became fixed and constant; by degrees, however, diffusing itself over the system, particularly the lower limbs. I do not recollect any pains in my head. But by the middle or latter part of the summer of 1838 I became greatly debilitated, yet was wit
h
out fever, the pulse not elevated. An uneasiness or pain in the lumbar region now caused me continual suffering. I had a feeling of great misery; could walk but a few steps without wanting to sit down; and if I did so it was a great effort to rise again. 
I
 had a sense of constant lassitude or weariness, and an indisposition to motion. I was perplexed by the symptoms. The least fatigue, and all motion fatigued me, aggravated the suffering. I have now a very vivid recollection of going with two or three frie
n
ds to pass a day at Nantasket Beach. We went out in a boat, and I well remember my sufferings as I lay listless in one end of it, trying by various changes to put myself in a posture of some ease, which I could not succeed in doing. I remember distinctly 
t
he question asked me by one of my companions: "Are you in pain?" I was scarcely able to get home. We rode in a carryall, and I remember the difficulty I had in supporting myself, holding as I could by different parts of the carriage. The bowels had now be
c
ome wholly inactive, and it was, I think, two days, at least, before they could be moved, and then very imperfectly. During this time I was in a most restless state, day and night. There was no sharp pain, but a constant dull, gnawing pain, more particula
r
ly in the lumbar region and bowels, and a tired feeling in all the limbs. I was every moment changing my position, seeking ease, but not for a moment finding it. I would get out of bed every little time and sit in a chair, or attempt to walk the room, but
 
it was all the same. There was no relief to be had. After the bowels had been effectually stirred, I found myself in a degree relieved. I went through the next year very well, keeping up my system of outdoor exercise so far as my duties allowed. In the la
t
ter part of winter, or in early spring, I had an attack, mainly, in the left side, apparently in the intercostal muscles. From this I recovered in no long time, and went on till late in the spring of 1840. Then and in the early part of the summer I had a 
r
eturn of the old symptoms described as occurring in 1838; only with this difference, that the development of the disease was much more rapid. I went through the same process of active medicines, injections, etc., before the bowels could be stirred. I beca
m
e more debilitated than before, the countenance assuming in a more marked degree the peculiar earthy yellow described by M. Tanquerel. Then came on the pure arthralgic pains. They seemed to be deep, as if in the very bone, and were seated more particularl
y
 in the flexor muscles, as the inside of the elbow-joints and the joints of the knees. Soon after, that is in July, there commenced a trembling of the fingers, which soon passed into decided paralysis, the paralysis increasing for about three weeks. This 
p
aralysis was in the extensor muscles of the fingers, wrist, forearm, and arm of both the upper limbs; the lower limbs, with a slight exception, not being affected. My arms when left to themselves hung loose and dangling at my sides, as if turning on a piv
o
t. Using only one at a time, I could elevate them only in a slight degree. I could not get my hand to my chin or mouth. But what puzzled me at that time was that there were certain motions which I could perform, for example, placing the palm of one hand a
g
ainst the back of the other, I could get them to my face; the flexor muscles of the hand, which were not paralyzed, being thus brought into action. So, too, I could draw on my boots almost as well as now, the same muscles acting. If my arms were elevated 
t
o a right angle with the body, the palm of the hand being turned downward, the whole hand fell at the wrist, hanging loose as a piece of cloth, and the will had no more power over it. I could not, without help, raise the hand in the least, not so much as 
o
ne of my fingers, in the slightest degree. When I took a tumbler to drink, I clasped it with both hands fully spread, and could so get it to my lips. When I ate I rested my right arm, below the elbow, on the edge of the table, and grasping the wrist with 
t
he left hand, and then bringing my mouth down to within three or four inches of the table, I could get the food to it. The backs of the hands became prominently arched; the fingers, when left to themselves, became bent and half shut, the natural consequen
c
e I suppose of loss of power in the extensor muscles. The rotary motion of the arms was entirely lost, a fact to which my attention was directed, when they attempted to assist me to put on my coat. I tried all I could to exercise the poor lame muscles, bu
t
 all fatigue, that is all use of them, seemed to be attended with injury. They had totally lost their contractile power. The abdominal muscles were similarly affected, though not in the same degree. If I had any it was only a slight power over them, which
 
gave me great trouble when an action of the bowels was needed, though they could at this time be readily moved by medicine. All the time there was more or less of arthralgic pain, more particularly at this period in the inside of the knee-joints. The pain
 
seemed to have no connection with the paralysis, and was greater in the parts not paralyzed than in those which were. The intercostal muscles on the left side were now affected; for months I could not sneeze; the moment the process began it was arrested b
y
 these muscles. The sensation was a very unpleasant one. I had no constant thirst, though I felt thirst at times, especially in the afternoon, or when unusually fatigued. I had little or no fever, though at one time a highly nervous pulse. I have spoken o
f
 the loss of the power of motion in certain muscles, or their loss of contractility. The sensibility of the muscles or nerves, with a slight exception, was not impaired, but the reverse. There was a soreness or peculiar tenderness in all my flesh. Sitting
 
in a common wooden chair and leaning back, the parts of the chair seemed to penetrate to the very bones. The exception referred to was a small muscle in the inner part of the left thigh. There was a spot there or four inches in length, and two or three in
 
breadth, which had lost its sensibility. There was at times a sensation of a peculiar and unpleasant kind at the bottom of my feet, a sort of burning, which I used to relieve, when in bed, by drawing up the covering and pressing the soles of my feet firml
y
 against the foot board, which produced a cool and agreeable sensation. I had also at times a violent pain in the back between the shoulders, rather nearer the right than the left shoulder, which I would relieve by getting on my bed and lying flat on my b
ack, bringing as much pressure to bear on the part affected as I could. This method mitigated the pain before a long time In a multitude of ways I was a great sufferer; but the brain I did not think was affected, and I do not now think it was, }{

\par }{The latter part of September his brother reported that at school he had fallen, and according to his description was }{\i\cf2 convulsed}{

strangely, and asked, "What he did so for?" he replied, "He did not know." The evening of the day of the attack at school, the nurse called his parents, after he had been asleep, saying that he was breathing strangely. Nothing abnormal appeared when we ar
r
ived, but in the course of an hour I heard the heavy and laborious breathing, and found him in a convulsion, which continued not over a minute. The eyeballs were distorted, and the body and arms flexed spasmodically. These attacks numbered seven or eight 
d
aily, and in the course of two or three days amounted to fifteen daily, which number daily continued until the middle or latter part of the following February, having, however, once numbered twenty-two to twenty-three in twenty-four hours; but this was wh
e
n the attacks were not the most protracted nor the most brief. The duration of each attack varied at different periods, from (I should judge from memory, not by the watch) one-third of a minute to one and a quarter or one and a half minutes. They did not 
vary }{\i\cf2 much}{
 in duration and severity usually during a period of twenty-four hours, but did in a period of weeks. The heavy, laborious, almost stertorous breathing was our first admonition during the early attacks (when he was asleep); soon this ceased, and du
ring the last month or two this symptom occurred only at the close of the convulsion, and was our first notice of its subsidence. Indeed, I remember failing to discover any sign of respiration during the greater part of an attack in some of the later week
s
. Some other symptoms varied in a like manner, as to order, during the whole period. A small quantity of saliva ejected from the mouth terminated many of the attacks, perhaps one-fourth of them. The turning in of the thumb upon the palm was sometimes noti
c
ed, but was not always or uniformly the case, while I think strong flexion of the fingers was a usual accompaniment. The strong contraction of the muscles of the back and neck, at the termination of the convulsions, was noticed during the severe attacks, 
b
ut did not accompany the lighter attacks. The attacks in the daytime were without premonition; sometimes he thought he had a slight dizziness a moment before, but was unable to notify us. To us the attacks seemed instantaneous; as when as cheerful as usua

d
ic action which characterizes mercurial tremor. This affection really constitutes the first stage of lead palsy; it is connected with a marked weakness of muscular contraction. When the parts affected by tremor are put in motion, their muscles seem to hes
i
tate or oscillate in their contractions, which are short-lasting, and doubtfully performed. Moreover there is always complaint of weakness in the parts affected by tremor, even when there is no fully developed paralysis. Upon saturnine tremor, when it has
 
lasted some time, there almost always supervenes a complete paralysis of one or more muscles of the affected-parts. The tremor is almost always restricted to a part or the whole of one limb, rarely affecting two at once; but it may involve both the upper

\par }{A. T., \'e6t. forty-nine years, is a ruddy, healthy lookin
g woman, and, excepting the paralysis of her left arm, considers herself well. The smallness and flatness of the left shoulder as compared with the right are very striking; the acromion projects forwards, and between it and the head of the humerus there i
s
 a furrow in which the index finger can be laid; the entire left upper arm is thinner than the right, especially on the flexor aspect; the forearm is overextended on the humerus and cannot be flexed by any effort of the patient. If you tell her to bend he
r
 left arm, she swings the whole limb upwards over her shoulder, and then the forearm falls of its own weight on the humerus. The arm bent by this means can be actively extended. If we partially bend the forearm upon the upper arm, and then ask patient to 
c
ontinue the movement, by a great exertion she is able to do so, but this is effected by the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundis, which can be seen and felt to contract. Supination of the left forearm is not possible; if the arm be passivel
y supinated pronation is readily effected. The movements of the left hand and fingers are in every respect free; the hand is a little curved and the skin bluish red, but no \'9c
dema or eruption is present; there is no atrophy of the interosseous or thenar musc
les; the arm can be raised from the shoulder in spite of the visible atrophy, and the clavicular fibres of the deltoid can be seen to contract; adduction, internal and external rotation, and drawing of the arm are all well performed, although the last is 
n
ot quite so perfect as on the right side; the right arm is quite normal, except a distinct atrophy of the ulnar side of the extensor aspect of the forearm, which is associated with inability to completely extend the fingers, the basal phalanges of the thu
m
b and index finger being alone perfectly extended, the remainder persisting in a state of half flexion in spite of the strongest voluntary efforts, the middle and ungual phalanges of the same fingers being, however, as perfectly flexed and extended as in 
h
ealth. She feels a certain subjective sense of weight in the left arm. Electrical examination gives the following: In the right arm the muscles all react well to direct and indirect stimulation, except the extensor communis digitorum, which does not exten
d
 the three fingers above mentioned; the extensor capri radialis reacts more feebly than normal, although its contour is prominent. In the left arm the deltoid reacts only near its origin from the clavicle; the biceps and both supinators are absolutely wit
h
out reaction; it is questionable whether or not some intact fibres of the long supinator exist in the upper arm where it is covered with fat. All the muscles of the arm, forearm, and hand react to both direct and indirect stimulation. Placing the electrod
e
 at the point mentioned by Erb, as that from which it is possible to stimulate both the biceps and long supinator together (at the exit of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves between the scaleni), gives a marked reaction of the muscles in question on the 
r
ight side, but remains without effect even, with much stronger currents on the left. With the anode of the constant current on the neck, and the cathode on the right deltoid, a feeble contraction occurs with twenty-two cells, while on the left side thirty
 
cells produce only a quick twitching of the clavicular fibres, the bulk of the muscles remaining unexcited; with thirty-three cells the remainder of the left deltoid reacts. The left biceps does not contract, the right contracts with thirteen cells. By st
i
mulating the right radical nerve with twenty cells, there is short quick movement in the index finger and thumb. The muscular fibres of the extensor communis, from the three outer fingers of the right hand, do not react to direct or indirect stimulation. 
A
ll the muscles of the left arm, innervated by the radial nerve, contract with twenty cells, except the supinators. We have in the case before us paralysis and atrophy of the deltoid, the biceps, and brachialis anticus, as well as of both supinators on the
 }{\i\cf2 left}{ side, and a part of the fibres of the extensor communis digitorum of the }{\i\cf2 right}{ side, }{\fs18\cf2 [587].\{al\}
\par }{After several attacks of colic one night, without any affection of the sensorium, paralysis of both hands and fingers supervened; }{\i\cf2 the shoulders and the upper arms remained freely movable}{
; extension of the forearm on both sides was free; equally flexion of the forearm on the upper arm; the first interosseous space was not only sunken, but there was decided atrophy of the ball of the thumb, and on both sides t
he interosseous spaces were sunken, and the interosseous muscles were atrophied and incapable of function, so that the lateral movements of the fingers and the extension of the middle and ungual phalanges were not possible; the hypothenar eminences were a
l
so diminished in both hands; there was also paralysis of the muscles supplied by the radial nerves on both sides, and of some of those supplied by the median and ulnar nerves. But these undoubtedly interesting phenomena pass into the background when we co
n
sider the result of electrical exploration. With the induced current of the muscles supplied by the radial nerve on the left (the less affected) side, only the extensor carpi ulnaris and supinator longus react, but very feebly; all the other muscles remai
n
 unaffected, and these by direct and indirect stimulation. On the other hand, the muscles supplied by the ulnar and median nerves on the left side contract very forcibly to both direct and indirect stimulation, but the adduction of the interosseous and th
enar muscles was very feeble, or almost }{\i\cf2 nil}{
. The same, only more marked in failure of reaction to the induced current, is the case on the right side; even with the strongest currents the supinator longus, a muscle which usually remains intact in lead-poison
ing, scarcely displays its contour, and in the feeblest outline the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longus et brevis display themselves, but without producing any corresponding movements. It is remarkable }{\i\cf2 
that muscles which have their functions quite unimpaired, and are used at will by the patient, and of the action of which he has never complained, should react either not at all, or only in the smallest degree to the strongest induced currents}{
. This is the case for both the deltoids (except the clav
icular portion), for the biceps and brachialis internus. With the constant current the deltoid, biceps, supinator longus, and the extensors of the hands and fingers of both sides, with strong currents (thirty to forty elements), give only fibrillar twitch
ings; in fact we have in the paralyzed, as well as the unparalyzed muscles, the most marked degenerative reaction, }{\fs18\cf2 [588].\{al\}

 at the sight of candles, the edges of the left of the eyelids commenced to burn, and photophobia came on. On reading or writing the eye watered, and the pain increased, preventing him going on with his work (third day). In the morning, on awaking, he cou

\par }{On the 22d of December, 1845, I examined the urine passed in the evening, in regard to its chemic
al constituents. It had a very pale white-wine color, and almost the appearance of so-called spastic urine; when first passed, and after standing some time, it was equally pure and clear, and had a specific gravity of 1018, that is, less than normal; a ma
r
ked acid reaction; an increased quantity of uric acid; a smaller quantity of nitrate of urea than normal; earthy phosphates increased; a large quantity of sulphates; a normal quantity of chlorides; phosphate of soda in large quantity; uroxanthin diminishe
d
. The morning and evening urine of the 23d of December had a specific gravity of 1015 and 1016, little ammonia, much free uric acid, and nearly a normal proportion of sulphates. The urine examined on the 24th of December had a specific gravity of 1021, th
a
t of the 28th of December, 1010, and that of the 31st of December, 1021. As regards their constituents, however, they exactly agree with the urine of the 22d of December. The urine passed in the morning of the 7th of January, 1846, was of a dark-sherry co
l
or, clear, deposited no sediment, had a strong acid reaction, and a specific gravity of 1017. The earthy phosphates, sulphates and uric acid were increased, the chlorides normal, the urea lessened. The morning urine of the 8th of January was pale bright-y
e
llow, clear, without sediment, acid; it had a specific gravity of 1020. The earthy phosphates, the sulphates, the phosphate of soda, and the uric acid were increased, the chlorides normal. The morning urine of the 9th of January was pale-sherry color, cle
a
r, without sediment, specific gravity 1021. The uric acid and all the salts increased, only the chlorides normal, the uroxanthin abundant, the urea diminished. The morning urine of the 14th of January had a specific gravity of 1019; the sulphates and the 
u
ric acid were very abundant. The morning urine of the 15th of January had a specific gravity of 1023, and a great deal of uroxanthin; otherwise similar to that of the previous day. From the 20th to 31st of January I made almost daily quantitative and qual
i
tative analyses of the urine. The morning urine was usually of a pale-sherry color, clear, and without sediment; the urine passed after dinner, or in the evening, was dark-sherry color. The specific gravity on the 20th was 1015, and the following five day
s
 1022. It had generally a strong acid reaction; abundance of uroxanthin; the urea, was a rule, diminished, the chlorides generally normal, the earthy phosphates somewhat increased, the phosphates of soda and sulphates much increased; the uric acid was dep
o
sited in much greater quantity than in the normal state, but was of very loose texture, and hence a large quantity weighed very little. Thus the urine of the 22d of January contained in 1000 parts 943.6 of water, and 56.4 of solid constituents, and among 
t
he latter uric acid formed only the 0.365th part. The urine of the 21st January contained in 1000 parts 949.6 of water, and 50.4 of solid constituents, of which the sulphates formed the 0.65th part. The urine on the 28th of January was also of a bright-ye
l
low color, clear, without sediment, strongly acid, its specific gravity 1016, but otherwise resembled that of the previous days. The qualitative analysis showed in 1000 parts 961.6 of water, and 38.4 of solid constituents. The uric acid was abundant. I to
o
k 22 grams of urine, precipitated the sulphates, and obtained 0.14 parts of sulphate of potash, which, consequently, in the proportion of 1000 parts showed the presence of the considerable quantity of 5.6 parts. On heating recently emitted urine in an amm
o
nia apparatus, the vapor arising tinged the litmus-paper blue, and the same reaction took place on adding caustic potash, which expelled the ammonia. Thus for three days there was free ammonia in my urine, which does not and should not occur in normal uri
n
e, and is to be ascribed to the action of the Sulphur. The urine of the 29th, 30th, and 31st of January was of a dark-sherry color, clear, and without sediment, had a specific gravity of 1018, 1019, and was not changed by heat; the urea was as usual small
 
in quantity, the chlorides normal, the earthy phosphates abundant, the sulphates, and the phosphate of soda very copious. The uric acid, which was deposited in great quantity, was combined with ammonia. In the urine of the 30th and 31st of January were tr
aces of iron; there can be no doubt that it came from the blood by a peculiar process of excretion, probably induced by the excess of Sulphur, }{\fs18\cf2 [29].\{al\}

 latter. The quantity of this fluid increased during the day, during which the pus gradually mingled with it. The red areola, which had surrounded the swelling as long as there was only pus in it, almost disappeared at first when the clear fluid collected
 
among the pus. In the course of the day, however, a redness appeared at the border of the collection, which, gradually becoming more intense and extending further, at length died away at an undefined limit. Conjoined with it, there was in the affected fin

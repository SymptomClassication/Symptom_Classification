opathically by Hyoscyamus. The true history of this 
fearful disease exhibits several varieties in men, for each of which must be given an exactly appropriate remedy; among these Hyoscyamus is not the last. For other cases Stramonium or Belladonna is the exact hom\'9c
opathic remedy according to the character of
 the attack. Belladonna has already made some complete cures, and it would have made more if other substances had not been combined with it impairing its power, and especially if it had not been given in such excessive doses, and thus at times the patient
 murdered by the remedy. }{\i\cf2 Large doses of drugs which are hom\'9copathic to a disease are far for more injurious than others which have no similarity or which have an opposite (antipathic) relation to the disease. In hom\'9c
opathic practice, when the totality of th
e symptoms of a disease is similar to the symptoms of the remedy, it is certainly a crime to give doses that are not very small, indeed, as small as possible; if, under such circumstances, doses are given of the size administered in the old blundering way
, they act as real poisons and are murderous}{. This I declare, convinced by a thousandfold experience, universally true of the exhibition of hom\'9c
opathic remedies in general, and especially when the diseases in acute, but more particularly true of the use of 
Belladonna, Stramonium, and Hyoscyamus in hydrophobia, each according to its kind; let no one come to me and say, "A certain case has one of these three remedies, even in the strongest doses, and not too seldom, but every two or three hours and neverthele
ss the patient has died." Just so, I say from full conviction, }{\i\cf2 just on this account has he died and thou hast killed him}{
; hadst thou administered the smallest portion of a drop of the fifteenth or thirtieth centesimal dilution of the juice of one of these h
erbs (in certain cases, a second dose after three or four days), then the patient would certainly have been saved. -Hahnemann.]

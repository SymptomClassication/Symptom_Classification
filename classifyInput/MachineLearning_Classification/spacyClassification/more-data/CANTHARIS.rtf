\par }{About midnight he was seized with strong desire to urinate. In spite of all his efforts he could pass only a few drops of scalding urine, attended with severe pain throughout the length of the ur
ethra, especially at the meatus, where he had a sensation like that of the pricking of pins. These symptoms became worse, and they were attended with priapism and severe pain in the genito-urinary organs, as well as in the lumbar region, and with intense 
t
hirst. At 9 P.M., he was much agitated, crying out and very restless. The eyes were injected and lustrous, the pupils dilated, and the countenance animated. The pulse was small and frequent. There was nausea with intense thirst. There was the most acute p
a
in in the urethra, rendered much worse when with great difficulty some drops of urine were expelled. The desire to micturate was incessant, and an acute state of nervous erethism was produced. Only a very small quantity of urine could be discharged; and t
h
is was thick and bloody. The abdomen was retracted and sensitive to pressure, especially in the hypogastric region, where the slightest touch produced acute pain. Pain was also felt in the lumbar region, owing to the kidneys being affected, and this pain 
extended downwards to the perin\'e6um. The catheter brought away a small quantity of thick bloody urine, containing album in marked proportion, }{\fs18\cf2 [122].\{al\}
\par }{He went to dinner at 6 P.M. (after half an hour), but had little or no appetite, and about 8.30 went to h
is room suffering much pain in his abdomen and in the region of the bladder. The first and most prominent symptom was an excruciating burning before passing water, which was increased as the water left the bladder. About 9 he commenced to have the most ex
c
ruciating pain in his bladder, with the continual desire to pass his water, which could only be pressed out in drops, but often bloody, and sometimes small clots would pass through the urethra, producing so much agony that he came near fainting on several
 occasions. About the same time his bowels moved several times, the passage being loose and without pain, except as the last f\'e6
ces passed from the rectum, when he would experience some pain and straining, which soon extended to the bladder, bringing on the 
most painful tenesmus, which was but little relieved when one or two drops of bloody urine passed. At 2 A.M. he complained mostly of a tearing-boring pain immediately over the region of the right kidney; it was painful for him to lie in any position, but 
w
hen his back was bent in, he felt more comfortable. At times he said the pain was most acute, and he would groan fearfully under the agony; this would last for several moments, when a short period of comparative ease would ensue, only to be succeeded by t
h
e old pain. This acute pain did not remain entirely localized to the region of the kidney, but followed the direction of the ureters. The desire to urinate was somewhat better, still every ten or fifteen minutes he would seize the chamber, and under the g
reatest agony pass sometimes one-half ounce of urine without any appreciable appearance of blood, when probably the next time he would pass urine the first drop seemed to be almost pure blood. It was as the last drops passed the sphincter vesic\'e6
 that the pain amounted to torture, and though a young man of courage, his self-possession would forsake him, and his face betrayed what his sufferings were, }{\fs18\cf2 [121].\{al\}
\par }{Burning feeling in and near orifice of urethra when passing water, and occasionally also when perfectly quiet; in the morning noticed the parts were slightly glued together (fourth day), }{\fs18\cf2 [121].\{al\}
\par }{The amount of urine passed this morning was four ounces; its color when held up to the light was a reddish brown, showing the presence of a small amount of b
lood. Neutral on test. On adding Nit. ac., also when heated, albumen was precipitated in abundance, amounting perhaps to 1/14 per cent. The presence of albumen was found to be caused by the large quantity of blood in the urine. Under the microscope a very
 
large number of blood-corpuscles, occasionally pus-corpuscles, epithelia of bladder, and spheroidal cells from the tubuli uriniferi and pelvis of kidney were to be found. The epithelia from the bladder were more numerous than those from the kidney. There 
w
as some mucus, with which the blood-corpuscles seemed to be intimately mixed. There were no crystals, no casts. The deposit at the bottom of the vessel, after standing some little time, was considerable (first day). Urine pale yellow. Reaction alkaline. A
l
bumen present, but in less quantity. Under the microscope there was a diminution of the blood-corpuscles, and epithelia from the bladder. The cells from the pelvis and kidney had diminished some in number (third day). Urine light yellow, much deposit, rea
c
tion alkaline. Albumen much decreased. Microscope shows a marked diminution of blood-corpuscles, a diminished number of cells from kidney and epithelia of bladder. On the other hand there was much mucus, intermixed with large quantities of urates, and som
e
 crystals of carbonate of ammonia (fifth day). Urine alkaline; no albumen; no blood corpuscles. Increase of mucus, urate, and epithelia of bladder, and an exceptional cell from kidney (eighth day). Urine alkaline, much sediment. Large quantities of mucus,
 
with epithelia of bladder, and an exceptional cell from pelvis of kidney (thirteenth day). Urine varied frequently in appearance now, sometimes being quite clear; this was more marked toward morning, whereas towards noon it would be quite cloudy. Color of
 urine passed in office decidedly more natural. Alkaline, large quantities of mucus, urates, epithelia from bladder, and crystals of carbonate of ammonia (nineteenth day), }{\fs18\cf2 [121]}{.\line

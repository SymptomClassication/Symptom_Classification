\par I touched my tongue with the cork moistened with the 1st cent. dil., but experiencing no effects beyond that which usually follows the application of Alcohol or Ether to the tongue, I put 2 drops into my mouth: At first I 
felt a kind of sweet and burning sensation, and soon afterwards a sense of fulness in head and slight tightness about throat, but without nausea or faintness. In a minute or two these effects went off, and could not help thinking that they were partially 
d
ue to imagination. I now took 5 drops more, and as these did not cause any increased uneasiness, I took in the course of a few minutes 10 more drops. Being at the time quite alone, I became somewhat alarmed lest I should have taken an overdose, and very s
o
on my pulse rose to above 100. The fulness in head and constriction in throat I thought were more marked than before. In a minute or two my courage returned, and the pulse soon fell to 90. The fulness in head lasted some time, and was followed by a slight
 
headache. I took a drop of pure Glonoin by degrees, and found that on bringing it in contact with the tongue it at first gave rise to a sweet flavor, which was rapidly followed by a most disagreeable acrid burning sensation, lasting several minutes. Immed
i
ately after taking the drop the pulse was 105. I imagined, too, that I felt fulness in head and some tightness about, throat; but as the effects gradually passed off in the course of a few minutes, I thought they were most probably due to fear and imagina
t
ion. March 29th, at 12.45 P.M.; my pulse being 80 and my breathing 22, I took a solution containing 1 part of Glonoin to 6 3/4 of spirit, a quantity equal to 1/6 drop of pure Glonoin. At 1 P.M. pulse was 90. I felt some fulness in head and slight tightnes
s
 about throat. At 1.5 P.M. I took 1/3 drop of pure Glonoin. In three minutes more pulse was 98. At 1.16 P.M. I took 1/2 drop, and in four minutes afterwards, my attention having been directed to another subject, the pulse was 94. At 1.30 P.M. I took a dro
p
 of pure Glonoin, and in six minutes the pulse was 106. In ten minutes more, when I had become convinced that I ran no risk, the pulse fell to 78, the breathing being 18. The effect on the heart's action I consider to be entirely due to fear. The head and
 neck symptoms are too constant to be attributed to the same cause, though I have no doubt the imagination exaggerates them, }{\fs18\cf2 [135].\{al\}
\par }{I took a minim of Glonoin, my pulse being 80. Half an hour before I had seen my brother take the same dose without any se
rious effect, and we now purposely changed the subject of conversation. In the course of a few minutes I exclaimed, "I feel drunk." This sensation was quickly followed by a dull aching pain at back of head, which was alternately better and worse, each acc
e
ssion becoming more and more severe. It soon extended to the forehead and the back of the neck, in which there was a decided feeling of stiffness. There was also some difficulty of swallowing, succeeded by nausea, retching, and flatulence. A profuse persp
i
ration ensued, and in fifteen minutes the symptoms began to abate, but I continued dull and heavy. My pulse was now 100. Considerable headache remained, which increased in the afterpart of the day to such an extent that, at 6 P.M., I was compelled to go t
o bed. At daybreak I was not relieved, but after a few hours more sleep I arose in my usual health, }{\fs18\cf2 [136].\{al\}

\par }{Table I.
\par }{\i\cf2 Table I.}{
\par Six provers first ascertained their normal pulse, then excited it by running at their utmost spee
d for about five minutes out of doors; immediately on returning to the room each prover's pulse was counted by another person, and at the same time, just as the counting began, four provers each took a drop of Glonoin in a teaspoonful of water. In five mi
n
utes the pulse of each prover was again counted; the result, as exhibited by the table, shows the pulse of the two who took no Glonoin to have been reduced 10 and 14 beats respectively; while the pulse of the other four who took Glonoin after running was 
reduced 40, 56, 56, and 14 beats respectively. So far the result agrees with that obtained by Dr. Hering. But the experiment shows also, certain undulations of the pulse. This was counted again ten or fifteen minutes after running. }{\i\cf2 No. 1}{
, who took no Glonoin, shows the pulse to have risen to 104 beats, after having previously sunk to 100. }{\i\cf2 No. 2}{, without Glonoin, shows a steady decline from 125 to 88. }{\i\cf2 No. 3}{
, with Glonoin, shows a steady decline from 140 to 88. in five and ten minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 4}{, with Glonoin, shows a decline from 144 to 88 in five and ten minutes, and then a rise to 96 in fifteen minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 5}{
 was still more remarkable in this respect, showing a rapid diminution of pulse, from 176 to 120 in five and to 104 in ten minutes, and then a rise up to 116 in ten minutes. Prover }{\i\cf2 No. 6}{
 showed a gradual decline. We have then a falling and rising of pulse, after severe exercise, without Glonoin, }{\i\cf2 but the falling and rising is much more marked in two out of four provers who took Glonoin}{. The next table exhibits
 the effects of Glonoin on the pulse of eight provers, without preceding exercise.

\par }{Table II.
\par }{\i\cf2 Table II.}{
\par Eight provers, five women and three men after ascertaining their normal pulse during rest, took 1 or 2 drops of Glonoin, and then counted the pulse every five minutes; the result was remarkable. The pulse of }{\i\cf2 No. 1}{
 sank from 88 to 86, and then to 84, as also observed by Dr. Hering. }{\i\cf2 Nos. 2, 3, and 4}{ showed a rise after five minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 5}{ showed first a falling in five minutes, then a rise after ten minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 6}{
 showed a rapid fall after two minutes, a rise in five, and a fall again in ten minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 7}{, having taken 2 drops, showed a decided fall in five minutes, and a rise in ten minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 8}{, like }{\i\cf2 No. 1}{
, after two drops, showed a decline both in five and ten minutes. Aside from the probable hom\'9copathic effect, we see in Table I that in two out of four instances (Nos. 4 and 5) there is a depression preceding a rise in the pulse, under the effect of G
lonoin given during excitement by running. And Table II shows four out of eight provers to have experienced a gradual increase of the pulse, and four others a very marked decline immediately after the medicine. }{\i\cf2 
This shows clearly in both tables that the pr
imary action of Glonoin may be depression as well as elevation of the pulse. And we would be justified in drawing the inference that all other symptoms are liable to exhibit such a fluctuation, illustrating how in one or in different individuals the same 
drug may produce opposite effects, which are not necessarily primary or secondary}{.
\par }{\field{\*\fldinst {\fs20 INCLUDEPICTURE  \\d "glon-10-537-1.jpg"}}{\fldrslt {\fs20\lang1024 }}}{\fs20 
\par }{Table III.
\par }{\i\cf2 Table III}{ is introduced to show that the pulse, having subsided after exercise, and having been excited aga
in soon afterwards by a second effort, will be reduced by Glonoin. This was the case with three provers out of five. In Nos. 1, 3, and 6 the pulse was reduced lower in eight minutes after Glonoin than it was without it. This most probably finds its explan
ation in Table II, showing that the primary effect may be both diminished and increased action of the pulse, according to the individuality of the prover. It will therefore not always act hom\'9c
opathically. Supposing, for instance, the prover to be one whose pulse is primarily depressed by Glonoin, it is then possible that the prover's pulse, when increased by running, would not be met by Glonoin hom\'9c
opathically, but antipathically; for it may be found higher eight minutes }{\i\cf2 after glonoin}{ was taken during arterial excitement, than it was eight minutes after such excitement }{\i\cf2 without the Glonoin}{. If hom\'9c
opathic, it should have reduced the pulse more quickly than it would have subsided of its own accord. The instance is illustrated by Nos. 2 and 4 of Table III. It is to be hoped that the subject will be established by further experiments.
\par }{\field{\*\fldinst {\fs20 INCLUDEPICTURE  \\d "glon-10-537-2.jpg"}}{\fldrslt {\fs20\lang1024 }}}{\fs20 
\par }{Table IV.
\par }{\i\cf2 Table IV}{ shows very similar results, illustrated by a larger num
ber of counts. The columns of Series I show a steady decline of the pulse after running without Glonoin; while the columns of Series II show a decidedly irregular falling and rising of the pulse, which first diminishes, then increased and finally diminish
es again. This was the case with provers 1, 2, and 5. }{\i\cf2 No. 1}{ had after excitement and Glonoin a diminution of pulse, till in eight minutes it rose from 102 to 108, then fell off again in ten minutes. }{\i\cf2 No. 2}{
, after a decided fall of pulse to 88 in three minutes, had an increase to 100 in four minutes, then a gradual decline. And }{\i\cf2 No. 5}{
, after having his pulse diminished to 92 in four minutes, had an increase to 96 in five minutes, and 104 in six and eight minutes, before falling to 100.
\par It Will be observed that prover }{\i\cf2 No. 2}{
, whose pulse was primarily depressed in Table II, showed considerable fluctuation in Table IV; he is the only prover who appears in both tables. So far we are able to conclude that the conditions of a prover may vary at different times, showin
g different results from the same experiment. Furthermore, that Glonoin may raise the pulse at once in some provers, and that it may primarily diminish it in others before elevating, it during the quiescent condition of provers (Table II), and that it wil
l affect it in a similar manner when the pulse has been excited by exercise (Table IV).
\par Though in a fair number of cases Glonoin will diminish the pulse quicker after its excitement by exercise than it would diminish without Glonoin, we also learn by Table IV that such hom\'9c
opathic diminution does not always occur, but that the pulse may sink even more slowly under Glonoin than without it, as also shown by provers 2 and 4 in Table III.
\par Another purely physiological effect is also apparent, when provers excite 
the pulse by running a second time in ten or fifteen minutes. It will then be slower to sink under Glonoin than if only one effort to excite the pulse had been made, as in Tables I and III.
\par The dose is also a matter of importance. In the above experiments 
drop doses of the tincture (1.80) were used, and it was observed several times that increase of dose caused differences of results; thus in Table II provers 7 and 8 had 2-drop doses, followed by rapid primary depression; these were men. Two women (Nos. 1 
and 5), taking only 1 drop, experienced from it the same effect as the men did from 2 drops.
\par Experiments are yet wanting to determine if higher attenuations will diminish the pulse quicker and with more certainty after running than the drop doses of tinctur
e used by the provers above named, and which failed in Table IV to produce a constant decline, but tended rather to elevate the pulse.
\par As for Glonoin as a substance, it is one of those whose active qualities are not latent or difficult to develop. Like its
 new relative, Nitrite of amyl, it acts more quickly upon the organism than most other substances. It is therefore well adapted to proving, and to illustrate to novices the effects of drugs upon the body, }{\fs18\cf2 [138].\{al\}
